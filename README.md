# RootGuard

## Operational Intelligence for Cyber Defence

**RootGuard is a professional knowledge base for cybersecurity operations.**

We built this for the people actually doing the work—SOC analysts, detection engineers, and incident responders. This is not a training course; it is a field manual. We provide the technical playbooks, detection logic, and forensic breakdowns you need to handle active threats in real-world environments.

Whether you are hunting for Active Directory compromise, analysing Windows artefacts, or tuning a SIEM, RootGuard bridges the gap between theory and the daily reality of the SOC.

### Our Mission

**This site exists to solve a specific problem:** to make actionable, deployment-ready documentation available to defenders.

Our goal is to help raise the standard of defence by sharing tested tradecraft. We focus on high-impact areas like Identity Security, Digital Forensics, and Detection Engineering, equipping you with the resources to detect sophisticated attacks and respond faster.

### Inside the Knowledge Base

**Detection Engineering & KQL**: Stop relying on default alerts. We provide the logic and KQL queries to detect advanced threats, with a deep focus on Active Directory attacks (Golden Ticket, Kerberoasting) and cloud identity risks.

Digital Forensics (DFIR) Deep-dive reference guides for when you need to reconstruct an incident.

* **Windows Forensics:** Registry analysis, ShimCache, AmCache, and evidence of execution.
* **Malware Analysis:** Static and dynamic analysis workflows to dissect malicious binaries.
* **Network Forensics:** Packet capture (PCAP) analysis using Wireshark and TShark.

**Incident Response Playbooks:** Structured workflows for handling live incidents. From "Attack Triage" to specific scenarios like "Privilege Escalation" or "Ransomware Containment", these guides help you move from alert to remediation without missing a step.

**Offensive Security for Defenders:** You cannot defend what you do not understand. We break down offensive techniques—like Login Brute Forcing, Credential Stuffing, and Lateral Movement—so you can engineer better detections and harden your perimeter.

### Why Use RootGuard?

* **No Fluff:** Pages are focused on technical utility—commands, logs, and analysis steps.
* **Platform Agnostic:** While we cover Microsoft Sentinel and Defender in depth, the principles apply to any SIEM or EDR.
* **Living Document:** The threat landscape changes fast. Documentation will evolve to cover new attack vectors and defence strategies as they emerge.
