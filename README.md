### **Welcome to Our DFIR Hub!**

Thanks for stopping by! This site is intended to be a hub for DFIR-related skills and knowledge sharing while providing support and guidance for new cybersecurity analysts. Whether you're a seasoned professional or simply curious about cyber defensive operations, our objective is to offer some help.

### **Where Are We Today?**

Access to good cybersecurity learning information is crucial for both aspiring and seasoned professionals. The rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats requires continuous education and up-to-date knowledge. Quality learning resources provide the foundational skills and advanced techniques needed to protect systems and data effectively. They also help professionals stay informed about the latest trends, tools, and best practices, ensuring they can adapt to new challenges and maintain robust security measures.

However, individuals looking to enter the cybersecurity field often face several challenges. One significant hurdle is the sheer volume of information and the complexity of the subject matter. Cybersecurity encompasses various domains, each requiring specialised knowledge. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of the industry means that new threats and technologies are constantly emerging, making it difficult for newcomers to keep up.

Another challenge is the lack of hands-on experience and practical skills. Many educational programs focus on theoretical knowledge, leaving students unprepared for real-world scenarios. This gap between theory and practice can make it challenging for individuals to secure entry-level positions, as employers often seek candidates with practical experience. Furthermore, the high cost of certifications and training programs can be a barrier for those seeking the necessary credentials.

To overcome these challenges, individuals can take several proactive steps. Seeking out reputable online courses, tutorials, and communities can provide valuable learning opportunities and support. Participating in cybersecurity competitions, such as Capture the Flag (CTF) events, can help build practical skills and gain hands-on experience. Additionally, pursuing internships or volunteer opportunities in cybersecurity can provide real-world exposure and enhance employability. By leveraging these resources and opportunities, aspiring cybersecurity professionals can overcome the challenges and build successful careers.

### **The Aim**

Our objective is to help other professionals develop their skills by sharing insights that may be helpful in their mission to safeguard their organisations. The threat landscape is constantly evolving; therefore, we must continuously upgrade our awareness and skills of attacker techniques and tactics. There is a constant demand for people with competent cybersecurity skills. However, it takes many years to reach a decent level of competence, a path with many challenges, such as access to resources, opportunities to gain hands-on experience, and the cost of certification. Nonetheless, compared to a decade ago, today, training resources are more freely available (YouTube), but even with the abundance of resources, there is still a shortage in the cybersecurity workforce and a challenge to land that first job.

While we will provide material useful at various levels, a considerable portion of our effort is focused on helping junior and entry-level analysts develop their careers or get into the field. We intend to do this by sharing our expertise and insights and providing actionable resources that can be utilised with a little effort. Explore the resources, test the tools mentioned, and if suitable, integrate them into your operational workflows and share them with other professionals.&#x20;

There is no silver bullet solution other than putting in the work; **push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you**. Cybersecurity, in whatever discipline or path you take, is a challenging but worthwhile career choice. There are a lot of good people who will help you get there, and I will introduce you to other professionals' incredible work and ask you to check out and support their work.
