# RootGuard

### Introduction

### Built for the Front Lines

This is **not** another beginner guide or certification checklist.&#x20;

RootGuard is a **battle-tested field** manual for SOC analysts, detection engineers, threat hunters, and incident responders who need to act—fast and decisively—when real threats hit.

We deliver n**o-fluff, deployment-ready resources**: precise KQL queries, forensic breakdowns, step-by-step playbooks, and analysis of attacker tradecraft you can use today to detect, contain, and eradicate threats.

### Focus Areas

* **Identity Security** → Master Active Directory and Entra ID attacks
* **Digital Forensics & Incident Response** → Reconstruct incidents with surgical precision
* **Detection Engineering** → Build high-fidelity alerts that actually matter

### What You'll Find

#### &#x20;Detection Engineering & KQL

High-signal detection logic for the attacks that bypass default rules:

* Golden/Silver Ticket forgery
* Kerberoasting & AS-REP Roasting
* DCSync, Pass-the-Ticket, Overpass-the-Hash
* Cloud identity compromise (Entra ID)\
  Ready-to-deploy **KQL queries** for Microsoft Sentinel & Defender

#### &#x20;Windows Forensics & DFIR

Deep artifact analysis to prove what happened:

* Registry hives (ShimCache, AmCache, UserAssist)
* Event Logs, Prefetch, SRUM, BAM
* Evidence of execution, persistence, and lateral movement\
  Structured timelines and correlation playbooks

#### &#x20;Incident Response Playbooks

From alert to remediation — no steps missed:

* Rapid Attack Triage
* Privilege Escalation Containment
* Ransomware Response & Recovery
* Data Exfiltration Detection & Blocking

#### Offensive Security for Defenders

Understand the adversary to defeat them:

* Credential attacks (Brute Force, Spraying, Stuffing)
* Lateral movement (PsExec, WMI, WinRM)
* Exploitation techniques and post-exploitation tradecraft

#### Malware & Network Forensics

* Static/dynamic malware dissection workflows
* PCAP analysis with Wireshark/TShark
* Behavioural indicators and hunting rules

#### Why RootGuard Stands Out

* **Actionable Firs**t — Commands, queries, logs, and exact steps
* **Platform Agnostic** — Core principles work everywhere; deep Microsoft ecosystem examples
* **Living Resource** — Continuously updated with emerging threats and community feedback
* **Defender-Centric** — Written from real incidents, for real defenders
