# RootGuard

### **Welcome to RootGuard!**

This site is intended to be a hub for DFIR-related skills and knowledge sharing, primarily providing support and guidance for beginners and those looking to enter the field; however, whether you are a seasoned professional or simply curious about cyber defensive operations, the objective is to offer some help.

In today’s fast-paced digital world, you need access to quality cybersecurity resources to stay ahead. Cyber threats evolve quickly, so keeping your knowledge current and skills sharp is essential for protecting systems and data. Here, you’ll find resources to help build your foundational skills, master advanced techniques, and stay up to date with the latest trends, tools, and best practices—the core capabilities needed to tackle challenges and boost your security knowledge.

Starting out in cybersecurity can feel overwhelming. You’re faced with a considerable amount of information and a complex field that spans multiple specialised areas, and the industry moves so fast that it’s hard to keep pace. Many training programs focus on theory, leaving you short on the practical experience employers often want. On top of that, the cost of certifications and courses can hold you back.

### **The Aim**

Our objective is to help other professionals develop their skills by sharing insights that may help improve their skillsets to better safeguard digital resources. The threat landscape constantly evolves; therefore, we must continuously upgrade our awareness and skills of attacker techniques and tactics. There is a constant demand for people with competent cybersecurity skills. However, it takes many years to reach a decent level of competence, a path with many challenges, such as access to resources, opportunities to gain real-world hands-on experience, and the cost of certification. Nonetheless, compared to a decade ago, today, training resources are more freely available (YouTube). However, despite the abundance of resources, there is still a shortage in the cybersecurity workforce and a challenge to land that first job.

While the material provided will be helpful at various levels, a considerable portion is focused on helping beginners and junior professionals develop their careers. The intention is to do this by sharing our expertise and insights and providing practical and actionable resources.

Explore the resources, test the tools mentioned, integrate them into your operational workflows, and share them with other professionals if suitable.

There is no silver bullet other than putting in the work; push yourself as no one else will do it for you. Cybersecurity, in whatever discipline or path you take, is a challenging but worthwhile career choice. There are lots of good people who will help you get there, and I will introduce you to other professionals' incredible work and ask you to check out and support them.
