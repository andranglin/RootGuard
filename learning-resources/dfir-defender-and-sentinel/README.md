# DFIR Defender & Sentinel

### Introduction

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. It provides detailed device information, including forensics information. Understanding all its features can feel overwhelming at first. There's much to explore, including attack surface reduction, next-generation protection, threat and vulnerability management, auto investigation and remediation, and more. However, the focus is on the DFIR capabilities, including its Live Response and KQL for threat detection and artifact analysis.

When conducting a forensic investigation, we want to take the approach of looking wide and then digging deeper into the data. This helps us avoid going down rabbit holes as much as possible and allows us to easily pivot to other data we have collected.&#x20;

MDE gives us loads of capabilities and options for approaching the investigation.
