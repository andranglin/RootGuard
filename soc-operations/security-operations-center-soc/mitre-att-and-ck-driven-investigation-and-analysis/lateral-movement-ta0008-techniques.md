# Lateral Movement (TA0008) Techniques

### Introduction

Forensically investigating lateral movement techniques on workstations and server systems is crucial to understanding how an attacker moves within a network after gaining initial access. Lateral movement involves techniques that enable an attacker to access and control remote systems within a network.

#### Understanding Common Lateral Movement Techniques

* **Remote Services:** Such as RDP, SSH, VNC.
* **Exploitation of Trust:** Utilising valid credentials or exploiting trusted relationships between systems.
* **Use of File Shares: Accessing network shares to move files or execute code.**
* **Pass-the-Hash/Pass-the-Ticket:** Stealing and reusing authentication tokens.
* **Remote Execution Tools:** Tools like PsExec or remote scripting like PowerShell Remoting.

#### Initial Data Collection

* **Forensic Imaging:** Create exact copies of the hard drives of affected systems using tools like FTK Imager or dd.
* **Memory Capture:** Capture volatile memory from systems using tools like WinPmem or Magnet RAM Capture.
* **Log Collection:** Gather security logs, system logs, application logs, and especially Windows Event Logs.

#### Analysing Remote Access

* **Security and System Logs:** Review logs for signs of remote access activities, like RDP logins (Event ID 4624 with logon type 10).
* **Authentication Logs:** Examine logs for abnormal authentication patterns or use of unusual user accounts.

#### Network Traffic Analysis

* **Network Monitoring Tools:** Use tools like Wireshark or Tcpdump to analyse network traffic for remote access protocols or unusual internal traffic patterns.
* **Flow Data Analysis:** Review NetFlow data for evidence of lateral movements.

#### Investigating Account Usage

* **User Account Analysis:** Look for evidence of unauthorised use of user accounts, especially privileged ones.
* **Pass-the-Hash/Pass-the-Ticket Detection:** Analyse memory dumps or security logs for signs of these techniques.

#### File and Directory Analysis

* **File Access and Movement:** Check file access logs for indications of files being accessed or moved in a manner consistent with lateral movement.
* **Artefact Analysis:** Look for artefacts left by remote execution tools or scripts.

#### Analysing Use of Remote Services

* **RDP, SSH, and Other Protocols:** Examine logs and settings related to these services for unauthorised access or configuration changes.
* **Service Configuration:** Review the configuration of services commonly used for lateral movement.

#### Specialised Forensic Tools Usage

* **Forensic Suites:** Tools like EnCase, Autopsy, or X-Ways for comprehensive analysis.
* **Sysinternals Suite:** For in-depth analysis of Windows systems, including tools like Process Explorer and TCPView.

#### Documentation and Reporting

* **Detailed Documentation:** Record all findings, processes used and evidence paths.
* **Forensic Report:** Compile a comprehensive report detailing the lateral movement investigation.

#### Post-Investigation Actions

* **Mitigation and Remediation:** Implement necessary measures to contain and eradicate the attacker's presence.
* **Recovery:** Restore affected systems from clean backups.
* **Enhancing Defenses:** Update security policies and tools based on the findings.

#### Key Considerations

* **Chain of Custody:** Maintain an accurate chain of custody for all forensic evidence.
* **Legal Compliance:** Ensure that the investigation complies with legal requirements.
* **Data Confidentiality:** Maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data throughout the investigation.

Lateral movement investigations require a detailed and methodical approach, as attackers often use sophisticated methods to avoid detection. Tailor the investigation to the specifics of the incident and the environment in which you are operating.
