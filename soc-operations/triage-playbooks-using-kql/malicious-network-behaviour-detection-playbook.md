# Malicious Network Behaviour Detection Playbook

### Introduction: The Need for Effective Malicious Network Behavior Detection Capabilities

As cyber threats continue to evolve, malicious network behaviour remains one of the most critical indicators of potential security breaches. Threat actors, whether external attackers or malicious insiders, often exploit network infrastructure to conduct reconnaissance, establish persistence, exfiltrate data, or deploy malware. Advanced tactics such as command-and-control (C2) communications, lateral movement, DNS tunneling, and encrypted traffic abuse make it increasingly difficult to detect malicious activities using traditional security measures. Given the complexity of modern enterprise networks—including cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments—organisations require proactive and scalable detection capabilities.

Effective malicious network behaviour detection capabilities and processes are essential to identifying and mitigating security threats before they escalate. A comprehensive detection strategy should incorporate real-time network traffic analysis, anomaly detection, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and threat intelligence integration. Security tools such as Network Detection and Response (NDR), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) enhance visibility into suspicious activities by correlating data across endpoints, networks, and identities.

To stay ahead of emerging threats, organisations must implement continuous monitoring, automated alerting, and forensic investigation capabilities for network traffic. Leveraging machine learning-driven anomaly detection, behavioural analytics, and proactive threat-hunting techniques further strengthens an organisation's ability to detect and respond to malicious network behaviour. By enhancing visibility and response processes, businesses can protect their critical assets, prevent data breaches, and maintain a resilient cybersecurity posture.

This playbook provides KQL queries and techniques to detect, analyse, and respond to malicious network behaviour using Microsoft Defender and Sentinel. Each section offers multiple query options with detailed descriptions and expected results.

### 1. **Initial Detection of Malicious Network Behaviour**

#### Query Option 1: Identify Abnormal Network Traffic Patterns

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where RemoteIPType == "Public" and BytesSent > 5000000
| summarize TotalBytesSent = sum(BytesSent) by DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress
| where TotalBytesSent > 10000000
| project DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, TotalBytesSent
```

**Description:** Detects devices sending large volumes of data to public IPs. Results highlight potential data exfiltration.

#### Query Option 2: Detect Communication with Known Malicious IPs

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where RemoteIPAddress in ("<malicious_ip_list>")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, Protocol
```

**Description:** Identifies communication with known malicious IP addresses. Results display devices and protocols involved.

#### Query Option 3: Monitor Suspicious DNS Queries

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where Protocol == "DNS" and strlen(RemoteDnsDomain) > 50
| summarize QueryCount = count() by RemoteDnsDomain
| where QueryCount > 100
| project RemoteDnsDomain, QueryCount
```

**Description:** Flags DNS queries with unusually long domain names, often used in DNS tunneling. Results display domains and query counts.

***

### 2. **Command and Control (C2) Indicators**

#### Query Option 1: Detect Long-Lived Connections

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where ConnectionDuration > 3600
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, ConnectionDuration
```

**Description:** Identifies network connections lasting longer than one hour, potentially indicating a C2 session. Results include devices and IP addresses.

#### Query Option 2: Identify Beaconing Activity

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize Interval = min(Timestamp) by DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress
| where Interval < 10s
| project DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, Interval
```

**Description:** Detects repeated communication with a consistent interval, characteristic of beaconing activity. Results include devices and IPs.

#### Query Option 3: Monitor HTTP/HTTPS Traffic for Suspicious Patterns

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where Protocol in ("HTTP", "HTTPS") and Url contains_any ("/login", "/auth")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, Url
```

**Description:** Tracks suspicious HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns, often used in C2 communications. Results display URLs and associated devices.

***

### 3. **Data Exfiltration Indicators**

#### Query Option 1: Large Outbound Data Transfers

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where BytesSent > 10000000
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, BytesSent
```

**Description:** Flags significant outbound data transfers. Results highlight devices and destination IPs.

#### Query Option 2: Detect Anomalous Cloud Storage Access

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
