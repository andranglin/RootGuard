# Social Engineering Detection Playbook

### Introduction: The Need for Effective Social Engineering Detection Capabilities

Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, making them one of the most effective and persistent threats to organisations. Cybercriminals use tactics such as phishing, pretexting, baiting, and impersonation to manipulate employees, executives, and even customers into divulging sensitive information, granting unauthorised access, or executing fraudulent transactions. As attackers leverage increasingly sophisticated methods—often enhanced by artificial intelligence and deepfake technology—organisations must adopt proactive detection and prevention strategies to mitigate these threats.

Effective social engineering detection capabilities and processes are essential to identifying and mitigating manipulation-based attacks before they result in security breaches. A robust detection strategy should integrate advanced email security, anomaly-based behaviour detection, real-time identity verification, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to monitor for suspicious communication patterns and access anomalies. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) can further enhance visibility into potential social engineering threats by detecting deviations from normal user activity.

To counter social engineering risks effectively, organisations must implement continuous monitoring, automated alerts, and adaptive security controls. Security awareness training, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and well-defined incident response protocols play a crucial role in reducing the likelihood of successful attacks. By strengthening detection capabilities and response processes, businesses can better protect their employees, customers, and sensitive data from the evolving threats posed by social engineering tactics.

This playbook outlines a structured methodology to detect, analyse, and respond to social engineering compromises using advanced KQL queries within Microsoft Defender and Sentinel. Each section provides multiple query options, detailed descriptions, and expected results.

### 1. **Initial Detection of Social Engineering Attempts**

#### Query Option 1: Identify Suspicious Emails

```kusto
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where Subject matches regex @"(verify|urgent|important|action required)"
| where SenderDomain endswith ".xyz" or SenderDomain endswith ".ru"
| project Timestamp, SenderEmailAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, SenderIP
```

**Description:** Detects emails with suspicious subjects or domains that are frequently used in social engineering campaigns. Results provide sender and recipient details.

#### Query Option 2: Detect Malicious URL Activity

```kusto
UrlClickEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where Url contains_any ("bit.ly", "tinyurl.com", "redirect")
| summarize ClickCount = count() by UserId, Url
| where ClickCount > 3
| project UserId, Url, ClickCount
```

**Description:** Tracks users clicking on potentially malicious URLs, indicating interaction with phishing links. Results display users and associated URLs.

#### Query Option 3: Unusual File Access Following Social Engineering Campaigns

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where FolderPath contains_any ("Finance", "HR", "Sensitive")
| summarize FileAccessCount = count() by DeviceName, AccountName, FolderPath
| where FileAccessCount > 10
| project DeviceName, AccountName, FolderPath, FileAccessCount
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Identifies users accessing sensitive files unusually, potentially due to social engineering exploitation. Results include account and device details.

***

### 2. **Compromised Account Indicators**

#### Query Option 1: Failed Login Attempts and Account Lockouts

```kusto
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ResultType == "Failure"
| summarize FailureCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where FailureCount > 5
| project UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, FailureCount
```

**Description:** Flags accounts with repeated login failures, which may indicate password guessing or credential stuffing. Results include usernames and IPs.

#### Query Option 2: Logins from Unusual Locations

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where Location != "<expected_location>"
| summarize LoginCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, Location, IPAddress
| where LoginCount > 1
| project UserPrincipalName, Location, IPAddress, LoginCount
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Detects accounts logging in from unexpected geolocations. Results display user details, login locations, and associated IPs.

#### Query Option 3: Unusual Privilege Elevation Attempts

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where ProcessCommandLine contains_any ("net user", "whoami", "nltest")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine, AccountName
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Identifies privilege elevation commands executed by compromised accounts. Results include command details and associated accounts.

***

### 3. **Payload Delivery and Execution**

#### Query Option 1: Malicious Attachments Execution

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where FileType in ("exe", "vbs", "bat") and FileName endswith_any (".exe", ".vbs", ".bat")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Detects execution of suspicious attachments commonly used in social engineering campaigns. Results display file execution details and associated devices.

#### Query Option 2: Command and Control Communication Detection

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where RemoteIPType == "Public" and BytesSent > 50000
| summarize TotalDataSent = sum(BytesSent) by DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress
| where TotalDataSent > 500000

### 6. **Conclusion**

The playbook offers a good approach to detecting and analysing compromises in an environment. However, its usefulness depends on the environment and tools at your disposal. For an environment where KQL is an option, the queries may require some adaptation to specific data sources and infrastructure setup.
