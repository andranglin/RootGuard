# Window Artifact Analysis

### What is Cyber Incident Management?

Cyber Incident Management is the systematic process of preparing for, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents that threaten an organisation's digital assets, data, or operational continuity. These incidents can range from malware infections, phishing attacks, and ransomware outbreaks to more complex threats such as data breaches, advanced persistent threats (APTs), or insider attacks.

The goal of cyber incident management is to minimise the impact of these incidents, protect critical assets, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. This involves a combination of proactive planning, timely detection, effective response, and post-incident analysis to ensure continuous improvement.

Cybersecurity incidents vary in nature and severity, necessitating different types of response strategies and management approaches. Below are common types of incidents and the corresponding approaches to incident response and management:

***

### Types of Incidents

**Malware Attacks:** Incidents involving viruses, ransomware, worms, or spyware that compromise systems or data.

**Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attempts to deceive employees into divulging sensitive information or credentials through fraudulent communication.

**Data Breaches:** Unauthorised access to sensitive information, often resulting in data theft or exposure.&#x20;

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** Overloading a system or network to render it inoperable.&#x20;

**Insider Threats:** Malicious or accidental actions by internal employees or contractors causing harm to the organisation.&#x20;

**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Long-term, sophisticated attacks by well-funded adversaries targeting critical infrastructure or intellectual property.&#x20;

**Supply Chain Attacks:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party vendors or suppliers to infiltrate the target organisation.

***

### Management and Approaches to Incident Response&#x20;

### Proactive Approaches

**Objective:** Minimise the likelihood and impact of incidents through preparation and prevention.

* Incident Response Plans (IRPs): Develop detailed playbooks for different types of incidents to ensure consistent responses.
* Threat Intelligence Integration: Use threat feeds to identify emerging risks and preempt attacks.
* Training and Awareness: Educate employees on cybersecurity best practices and common attack vectors.

### Importance of Cyber Incident Management&#x20;

Effective cybersecurity incident management relies on the integration of people, processes and technology to effectively address cyber threats. Well-defined processes provide a structured and repeatable approach for identifying, responding to, and recovering from incidents, ensuring that no critical step is overlooked. Skilled and well-trained personnel act as the frontline defenders, capable of analysing threats, making informed decisions, and coordinating responses under pressure. Advanced technology, including tools for detection, analysis, and automation, empowers teams to identify incidents faster, mitigate damage, and adapt to evolving threats.

When these three elements work in harmony, organisations can minimise the impact of cyber incidents, protect sensitive data, and maintain operational continuity. Strong incident management processes foster resilience, reduce downtime, and build trust with stakeholders, demonstrating a commitment to robust cybersecurity practices. Conversely, gaps in any of these areas can lead to delayed responses, increased damage, and long-term reputational harm. This underscores the importance of continually refining processes, investing in skilled personnel, and adopting cutting-edge technologies to stay ahead in an ever-changing threat landscape.
