# Velociraptor Artifacts Analysis

### Hunting for Ransomware Activities

Malware remains one of the most pervasive and damaging cyber threats organisations face today. It involves software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorised access to computer systems. Hunting for malware activities is a proactive approach to detect and mitigate malware before it can execute its payload. With tools like Velociraptor to uncover the signs of malware infection and, ultimately, system compromise. Velociraptor, an open-source endpoint monitoring and forensic platform, is excellent at unearthing unusual file access patterns, lateral movement, and command execution.
