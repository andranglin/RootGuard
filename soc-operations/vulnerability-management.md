# Vulnerability Management

### Introduction to Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is a critical cybersecurity practice that involves identifying, assessing, prioritising, and mitigating vulnerabilities within an organisation's IT infrastructure. It is a proactive approach to reducing the attack surface and preventing potential exploits by malicious actors. Vulnerabilities can exist in various forms, including software flaws, misconfigurations, outdated systems, and weak credentials. Effective vulnerability management requires continuous monitoring and a structured process to ensure that risks are addressed promptly. By implementing a robust vulnerability management program, organisations can significantly enhance their security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.

The vulnerability management process typically begins with asset discovery and inventory, where organisations identify all devices, applications, and systems within their environment. This step is crucial because vulnerabilities cannot be managed if the assets are unknown. Once the inventory is established, vulnerability scanning tools are used to detect weaknesses across the infrastructure. These tools generate reports highlighting vulnerabilities, often categorising them by severity using scoring systems like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The next step involves prioritising vulnerabilities based on factors such as exploitability, potential impact, and the criticality of the affected assets. This prioritisation ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to address the most significant risks first.

After prioritisation, organisations must remediate or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. Remediation involves applying patches, updating software, or reconfiguring systems to eliminate the vulnerability. In cases where immediate remediation is not feasible, mitigation strategies such as implementing compensating controls or isolating affected systems may be employed. Continuous monitoring and reassessment are essential to ensure that new vulnerabilities are detected and addressed as they emerge. Additionally, organisations should integrate vulnerability management with other security practices, such as threat intelligence and incident response, to create a comprehensive defence strategy.

For organisations, vulnerability management is not a one-time effort but an ongoing cycle that requires collaboration across teams, including IT, security, and business units. It also demands investment in the right tools, training, and processes to stay ahead of evolving threats. Regulatory compliance and industry standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, often mandate vulnerability management as part of an organisation's security framework. By adopting a proactive and systematic approach to vulnerability management, organisations can minimise risks, protect sensitive data, and maintain the trust of customers and stakeholders in an increasingly digital world.

A successful vulnerability management program relies on a combination of advanced tools and well-defined processes to effectively identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities. Tools such as Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provide comprehensive scanning capabilities, enabling organisations to detect vulnerabilities across networks, endpoints, and cloud environments. These tools often integrate with threat intelligence feeds to prioritise vulnerabilities based on real-world exploit activity and emerging threats. Additionally, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms like Azure Sentinel or Splunk can correlate vulnerability data with other security events, providing a holistic view of the organisation's risk landscape. Automation plays a key role in streamlining processes, from scheduling scans to deploying patches, reducing the time between detection and remediation.

Processes are equally important, as they ensure consistency and accountability in vulnerability management. A typical workflow includes regular scanning schedules, risk assessment frameworks, and clear escalation paths for critical vulnerabilities. Organisations often adopt frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or MITRE ATT\&CK to guide their vulnerability management strategies. Collaboration between IT and security teams is essential to balance remediation efforts with operational continuity. Furthermore, organisations should establish metrics and reporting mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of their vulnerability management program, such as mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to remediate (MTTR). By combining the right tools with structured processes, organisations can build a resilient vulnerability management program that adapts to evolving threats and safeguards their digital assets.
