# Security Identifier (SID) History Compromise

### **Introduction**

In Microsoft Active Directory (AD), the **Security Identifier (SID) History** attribute is used to maintain a record of SIDs from previous domains when objects like users or groups are migrated. This allows users to retain access to resources in the original domain without requiring reconfiguration. While SID History is essential for seamless domain migrations and consolidations, it can be exploited in a **SID History Compromise** attack.

Every object in AD DS has a unique and immutable SID that AD DS uses to identify the object and determine its privileges when accessing systems, services and resources. As usernames can be changed, AD DS relies on the SID to distinguish between objects to ensure that the correct access is provided to an object. In addition to the ‘SID’ attribute, there is the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute which stores previous SIDs. If a SID is changed, for example, when an object is migrated from one domain to another, the object will be given a new SID and its previous SID will be stored in the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute.

Attackers who compromise an account with privileged access, such as a domain administrator, can inject arbitrary SIDs, including those of privileged groups like "Domain Admins" or "Enterprise Admins," into the SID History attribute of another account. This grants the attacker unauthorized access to resources and privileges across domains, bypassing standard access controls.

***

### **Attack Description**

Threat actors can exploit the SID History functionality to establish persistence and hide in an AD DS environment. This technique is performed after the attacker achieves initial access and privilege escalation and requires administrator privileges to a Domain Controller. With this access, malicious actors can add a SID to the sIDHistory of an object they control. The SID added to the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute is typically from a privileged user object or security group, such as the default administrator user object or the Domain Admins security group.

A **SID History Compromise** attack typically involves:

1. **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker compromises an account with sufficient privileges to modify SID History attributes (e.g., a domain administrator account).
2. **SID Injection**: Using tools like Mimikatz, the attacker injects a privileged SID (e.g., Domain Admins SID) into the SID History attribute of a low-privileged user or service account.
3. **Access Resources**: The compromised account now inherits the permissions associated with the injected SID, allowing unauthorized access to resources or escalation of privileges.
4. **Stealth and Persistence**: Since SID History is an attribute tied to AD objects, the attack can persist unless the attribute is thoroughly audited.

SID History compromise is dangerous because it bypasses traditional privilege monitoring, focusing on assigned roles rather than inherited permissions.

***

### **Detection Techniques**

1. **Monitor for Changes in SID History**:
   * Use audit logs to detect modifications to the SID History attribute. Changes should be rare and correlate with legitimate migration activities.
   * Event ID 5136 (Directory Service Object Modification) in AD logs can track changes to attributes like SID History.
2. **Detect Unusual Privileged Access**:
   * Identify non-privileged accounts accessing resources typically restricted to administrators.
   * Look for anomalous account logons or access patterns.
3. **Correlate Account Privileges**:
   * Compare an account's explicit group membership against inherited permissions from SID History. Sudden elevation in access can indicate abuse.
4.  **Events that Detect a SID History Compromise:**

    Source of events: Domain Controllers

    * **Event ID 1102:** Events generated when the ‘Security’ audit log is cleared. To avoid detection, malicious actors may clear this audit log to remove any evidence of their activities. Analysing this event can assist in identifying if a Domain Controller has been compromised.
    * **Event ID 4103:** Events generated when PowerShell executes and logs pipeline execution details. Common malicious tools used to execute a SID History compromise, such as Mimikatz, use PowerShell. Analysing this event for PowerShell execution relating to SID History may indicate dumping of the ntds.dit file.
    * **Event ID 4104:** Events generated when PowerShell executes code to capture scripts and commands. Common malicious tools used to execute a SID History compromise, such as Mimikatz, use PowerShell. Analysing this event for PowerShell execution relating to SID History may indicate dumping of the ntds.dit file.
    * **Events ID 4675:** Events generated when SIDs are filtered. Domain hopping with Golden Tickets and SID History may use SIDs that get filtered. If this event is generated, it may indicate a SID History compromise has been attempted.
    * **Event ID 4738:** Events generated when the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute is modified for a user object.
5. **Analyse Logon Sessions**:
   * Track Event ID 4624 (Logon Success) and correlate with resource access logs to detect unauthorised use of inherited permissions.

***

### **Mitigation Techniques**

1. **Restrict Access to Modify SID History**:
   * Limit permissions to modify SID History attributes to a small, trusted group of administrators.
   * Regularly review and validate permissions using tools like `dsacls`.
2. **Enable Advanced Auditing**:
   * Enable auditing for directory service changes to capture SID History modifications (Event ID 5136).
   * Centralise logs in a SIEM solution for continuous monitoring.
3. **Regularly Audit SID History**:
   * Use scripts or tools to identify accounts with unexpected or privileged SIDs in their SID History.
   * Remove unnecessary SIDs from the attribute after verifying resource access requirements.
4. **Deploy Conditional Access and MFA**:
   * Use conditional access policies to restrict privileged account usage and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative actions.
5. **Monitor and Detect Anomalies**:
   * Employ User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to detect unusual privilege escalation or resource access patterns.
   * Analyse historical data to establish baselines for normal account behaviour.
6. **Harden Domain Controllers**:
   * Restrict direct access to domain controllers and enforce stringent security policies to minimise the risk of compromise.
7. **The following security controls should be implemented to mitigate a SID History compromise:**
   * Ensure the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute is not used. Unless migrating user objects from one domain to another, the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute should not be required. If no user objects are configured with this attribute, then a SID History compromise is not possible.
   * Ensure the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute is checked weekly. Malicious actors may add a value to the ‘sIDHistory’ attribute of a user object they control to establish persistence. Regularly checking for this attribute on Active Directory objects may increase detection of this persistence strategy.
   * Enable SID Filtering for domain and forest trusts. This prevents SIDs of built-in security groups, such as Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins, being used in TGTs across domains. However, malicious actors can still use the SIDs of other security groups if the Relative Identifier is greater than 1000.

***

By monitoring and auditing the use of SID History, organisations can reduce the risk of compromise, detect unauthorised changes promptly, and maintain a secure AD environment. These practices also mitigate the persistence and impact of SID History-related attacks.
