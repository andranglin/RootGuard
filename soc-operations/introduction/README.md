# Security Operations Center (SOC)

## What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralised function that serves as the nerve centre for an organisation’s security operations. The SOC is responsible for monitoring, detecting, analysing, and responding to ssecurity incidents in realtime to protect the organisation’s data, systems, and networks. It is staffed with skilled security professionals and equipped with advanced tools and technologies to proactively identify potential threats and mitigate risks.

### Key SOC Functions:

* Continuous monitoring of network traffic and system logs.
* Incident detection and response.
* Threat intelligence collection and analysis.
* Vulnerability assessment and management.
* Collaboration with other IT and security teams.
* Reporting on security posture and incidents.

SOCs operate 24/7 in most cases to ensure round-the-clock protection against evolving cyber threats, making them an essential component of modern security strategies.

### Required Skillset of a SOC Analyst

A SOC Analyst plays a critical role in detecting security threats. To excel in this role, individuals must possess a combination of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and communication skills.

#### Core Technical Skills:

1. **Network Security**:
   * Understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls, and VPNs.
   * Familiarity with network intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
2. **Endpoint Security**:
   * Knowledge of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
   * Proficiency in analysing system logs and monitoring endpoint activities.
3. **Threat Analysis**:
   * Understanding the MITRE ATT\&CK framework and other frameworks.
   * Ability to analyse malware, phishing attempts, and other threats.
4. **SIEM Tools**:
   * Proficiency in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools like Splunk, Sentinel, or QRadar.
5. **Incident Response**:
   * Skills in triaging, investigating, and remediating security incidents.
   * Experience with digital forensics tools and techniques.
6. **Scripting and Automation**:
   * Familiarity with Python, PowerShell, or Bash to automate routine tasks.

#### Soft Skills:

* **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving:** Ability to quickly assess and respond to evolving threats.
* **Communication Skills:** Clear articulation of technical findings to non-technical stakeholders.
* **Teamwork:** Collaboration with other SOC analysts and IT teams.
* **Attention to Detail:** Meticulous review of logs and alerts to identify anomalies.
