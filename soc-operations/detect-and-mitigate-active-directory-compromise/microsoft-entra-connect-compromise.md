# Microsoft Entra Connect Compromise

### **Introduction**

Microsoft Entra Connect (formerly Azure AD Connect) is a critical tool for synchronising on-premises Active Directory (AD) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It allows organisations to manage identities across hybrid environments seamlessly. A **Microsoft Entra Connect Compromise** occurs when attackers exploit misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or compromised credentials related to the Entra Connect server or its components. Such compromises can enable adversaries to manipulate identity synchronisation, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate sensitive data.

Due to its role in bridging on-premises and cloud environments, the Entra Connect server is a high-value target. If compromised, attackers can pivot between on-premises infrastructure and Azure AD, posing significant risks, such as unauthorised access, data breaches, and loss of identity control.

***

### **Attack Description**

A Microsoft Entra Connect compromise typically involves the attacker gaining access to the Entra Connect server or its service accounts. Attackers may exploit:

1. **Compromised Credentials**: Access to the highly privileged service account used for directory synchronisation can allow attackers to manipulate or inject malicious changes into synchronised identities.
2. **Misconfigurations**: Weak configurations, such as insecure storage of credentials or overly permissive access controls, can be exploited.
3. **Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in the Entra Connect software.
4. **Pass-through Authentication (PTA) or Password Hash Sync (PHS)**: Attackers may intercept authentication requests or alter synchronisation to gain unauthorised access.

Once compromised, attackers can:

* Elevate privileges by creating or modifying accounts in Azure AD.
* Synchronise malicious changes to on-premises AD.
* Extract password hashes for offline cracking.
* Disable security configurations, such as MFA or conditional access policies.

***

### **Detection Techniques**

1. **Events that Detect a Microsoft Entra Connect Compromise:**

**Source of Events:** Microsoft Entra Connect Servers

* **Event ID 611:** Event generated when the PHS has failed. This event can be analysed to identify unusual password synchronisation activity that could indicate a compromise against Microsoft Entra Connect.
* **Event ID 650:** Events generated when password synchronisation starts retrieving updated passwords from Active Directory. This event can be analysed to identify unusual password synchronisation activity that could indicate a compromise against Microsoft Entra Connect.
* **Event ID 651:** Events generated when password synchronisation finishes retrieving updated passwords from Active Directory. This event can be analysed to identify unusual password synchronisation activity that could indicate a compromise against Microsoft Entra Connect.
* **Event ID 656:** Events generated when password synchronisation indicates that a password change occurred and there was an attempt to sync this password to Microsoft Entra ID. This event can be analysed to identify unusual password synchronisation activity that could indicate a compromise against Microsoft Entra Connect.
* **Event ID 657:** Events generated when a password change request is successfully sent to Microsoft Entra ID. This event can be analysed to identify unusual password synchronisation activity that could indicate a compromise against Microsoft Entra Connect.
* Event ID 1102: Events generated when the ‘Security’ audit log is cleared. To avoid detection, malicious actors may clear this audit log to remove any evidence of their activities. Analysing this event can assist in identifying if a Microsoft Entra Connect server has been compromised.
* **Event ID 4103:** Events generated when PowerShell executes and logs pipeline execution details. AADInternals, a popular toolkit used for exploiting Microsoft Entra Connect, uses PowerShell for its execution. This event can indicate the use of PowerShell-based malicious tools, which may assist in identifying if a malicious actor attempted to exploit Microsoft Entra Connect.
* **Event ID 4104:** Events generated when PowerShell executes code to capture scripts and commands. AADInternals, a popular toolkit used for exploiting Microsoft Entra Connect, uses PowerShell for its execution. This event can indicate the use of PowerShell-based malicious tools, which may assist in identifying if a malicious actor attempted to exploit Microsoft Entra Connect.

2. **Secure Entra Connect Server**:

* Restrict access to the server to only necessary administrators and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Apply the principle of least privilege to all service accounts and ensure they are used solely for their intended purpose.

3. **Update and Patch Regularly**:

* Keep Microsoft Entra Connect software up to date to address vulnerabilities.
* Apply security patches for both the operating system and associated components.

4. **Enable Advanced Logging**:

* Enable Azure AD audit and sign-in logs for comprehensive visibility.
* Enable and monitor directory synchronisation logs to detect unauthorised changes.

5. **Monitor Unusual Activities**:

* Track changes in synchronised objects, such as new privileged accounts or altered group memberships.
* Identify suspicious synchronisation activities, including unexpected schema changes or frequent sync cycles.

6. **Log Analysis**:

* Analyse Entra Connect server logs for anomalous events, such as:
  * Unauthorised access attempts.
  * Changes to synchronisation configurations.
  * Updates to the synchronisation schedule.
* Use Azure AD logs to detect unusual admin activities, such as privilege escalation or MFA disabling.

7. **Network Traffic Analysis**:

* Monitor for unexpected communication from the Entra Connect server, such as connections to unauthorised external IPs.

8. **Behavioural Analysis**:

* Use User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to detect deviations from normal behaviour of Entra Connect-related accounts or services.

```
{% endcode %}

#### **How This Query Works**

1. **Detect Configuration Changes**:
   * The first section (`ConfigChangeEvents`) looks for operations that modify directory synchronisation settings, such as schema updates or configuration rule changes.
2. **Privileged Account Activity**:
   * The second section (`PrivilegedAccountActivity`) identifies suspicious activities from privileged accounts associated with Entra Connect. It flags:
     * Accounts bypassing conditional access policies or MFA.
     * Repeated login attempts with unusual results.
3. **Unexpected Synchronisation**:
   * The third section (`SyncActivity`) monitors frequent synchronisation operations initiated within a short time frame, which may indicate unauthorised activity.
4. **Correlation**:
   * The final section correlates all detected anomalies (config changes, privileged access, and unexpected synchronisation) to surface potential compromises.

***

#### **Customisations**

* Replace `@yourdomain.com` with your organisation’s domain.
