# Golden Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

### Introduction

The **Golden SAML** attack is a sophisticated technique targeting federated identity systems that utilise Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for authentication. In this attack, adversaries exploit the trust relationship between identity providers (IdPs) and service providers (SPs) to forge authentication tokens. By compromising the private key of the IdP or gaining administrative access, attackers can create valid SAML assertions, impersonate any user (including administrators), and gain unauthorised access to federated services. This attack is particularly dangerous in cloud environments, such as Office 365, AWS, and GCP, where SAML is commonly used for single sign-on (SSO).

***

### Attack Description

SAML is a widely adopted standard for enabling SSO, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple services. The IdP generates and signs SAML assertions, which the SPs trust to grant access. In a Golden SAML attack, an attacker obtains the IdP’s private key or gains access to its signing mechanisms. With this, they can forge SAML tokens without interacting with the IdP or triggering authentication processes. These forged tokens allow attackers to impersonate any user and access any resource that trusts the IdP.

Golden SAML attacks are highly stealthy since they bypass standard authentication logs and audits. They are particularly effective for lateral movement and persistence in compromised environments, as the attacker can continually generate valid tokens as long as they have access to the signing key.

***

### **Detection Techniques**

Detecting a Golden SAML can be challenging, especially after threat actors have compromised the environment and are using forged SAML responses to access service providers. The first opportunity to detect a Golden SAML is the generation of event 70, resulting from the compromise of an AD FS server and the export of the private key. Event 70 can be analysed to determine whether the export was authorised. If attackers successfully execute a Golden SAML and forge SAML responses to authenticate to service providers, then the AD FS and service provider's authentication events can be correlated to identify inconsistencies that may indicate the use of forged SAML responses.

1. **Events that detect a Golden SAML**
   * **Event ID 70:** Event generated when a certificate’s private key is exported. Extracting the private key is the first step in a Golden SAML.
   * **Event ID 307:** Event generated when there is a change to the AD FS configuration. Malicious actors may add a new trusted AD FS server they can control instead of extracting the certificate and other information from an existing AD FS server.
   * **Event ID 510:** The event provides additional information and can be correlated with event 307 with the same instance ID. Any events generated for changes to AD FS should be investigated to confirm if the changes were authorised or not.
   * **Event ID 1007:** Event generated when a certificate is exported. The first step of a Golden SAML is to export the signing certificate from an AD FS server.
   * **Event ID 1102:** Event generated when the ‘Security’ audit log is cleared. To avoid detection, malicious actors may clear this audit log to remove any evidence of their activities. Analysing this event can assist in identifying if an AD FS server has been compromised.
   * **Event ID 1200:** Event generated when AD FS issues a valid token as part of the authentication process with a service provider, such as Microsoft 365 or Azure. A Golden SAML bypass AD FS servers, resulting in the absence of this event (and event 1202). This event can be correlated with authentication events from service providers to identify the absence of AD FS authentication events, which may be a sign that a forged SAML response was used.
   * **Event ID 1202:** Event generated when AD FS validates a new credential as part of the authentication process with a service provider, such as Microsoft 365 or Azure. A Golden SAML bypasses AD FS servers, resulting in the absence of this event (and event 1200). This event can be correlated with authentication events from service providers to identify the absence of AD FS authentication events, which may be a sign that a forged SAML response was used.
   * **Event ID 4662:** Event generated when the AD FS DKM container in Active Directory is accessed. The ‘Active Directory Service Access’ setting needs to be configured for auditing with ‘Read All Properties’ configured for the AD FS parent and child containers in Active Directory. This event should be monitored for the ‘thumbnailPhoto’ attribute with a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) value matching ‘{8d3bca50-1d7e-11d0-a081-00aa006c33ed}’. This attributed GUID stores the DKM master key and should only be periodically accessed by the AD FS service account. Each time this event is generated, it should be analysed to determine if the activity was authorised.
2. **Monitor SAML Assertions**:
   * Analyse SAML assertion logs for anomalies such as tokens issued without corresponding authentication events or with extended lifetimes.
   * Look for tokens generated for high-privilege accounts, especially during non-business hours or from unusual locations.
3. **Cross-Check Authentication Events**:
   * Correlate authentication logs from SPs with IdP logs to identify discrepancies, such as tokens being used without a matching authentication event.
4. **Monitor Administrative Activity**:
   * Track changes to IdP configurations, particularly updates to signing certificates or unusual administrative access patterns.
5. **Behavioural Analysis**:
   * Use user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) to detect unusual activities from accounts, such as accessing multiple high-value resources in a short timeframe.

***

### **Mitigation Techniques**

1. **The following security controls should be implemented to mitigate a Golden SAML**:
   * Ensure the AD FS service account is a gMSA. This minimises the likelihood of the account being compromised via other techniques, such as Kerberoasting or DCSync.
   * Ensure the AD FS service account is used only for AD FS and no other purpose. By using the AD FS service account only for AD FS, and no other purpose, it reduces its attack surface by not exposing its credentials to other systems.
   * Ensure passwords for AD FS server local administrator accounts are long (30-character minimum), unique, unpredictable, and managed. Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) can be used to achieve this. Threat actors can target local administrator accounts to gain access to AD FS servers, so these accounts need to be protected from compromise.
   * Limit access to AD FS servers to only privileged users that require access. This may be a smaller subset of privileged users than the Domain Admins security group. This reduces the number of opportunities for malicious actors to gain access to AD FS servers.
   * Restrict privileged access pathways to AD FS servers to jump servers and secure admin workstations using only the ports and services that are required. AD FS servers are classified as ‘Tier 0’ assets within Microsoft’s ‘Enterprise Access Model’.
   * Only use AD FS servers for AD FS and ensure no other non-security-related services or applications are installed. This reduces the attack surface of AD FS servers as there are fewer services, ports, and applications that may be vulnerable and can be used to compromise an AD FS server.  Centrally log and analyse AD FS server logs in a timely manner to identify malicious activity. If malicious actors gain privileged access to AD FS servers, this activity should be identified as soon as possible to respond and limit the impact.
   * Encrypt and securely store backups of AD FS servers and limit access to only Backup Administrators. Backups of AD FS servers need to be afforded the same security as the actual AD FS servers. Malicious actors may target backup systems to gain access to critical and sensitive computer objects, such as AD FS servers.&#x20;
   * Rotate AD FS token-signing and encryption certificates every 12 months, or sooner if an AD FS server has been compromised or suspected to have been compromised. Both certificates need to be rotated twice in rapid succession to revoke all existing AD FS tokens.
2. **Secure Private Keys**:
   * Protect IdP private keys using hardware security modules (HSMs) or equivalent secure storage solutions.
   * Regularly rotate signing certificates and keys to limit the impact of potential compromise.
3. **Enable Logging and Auditing**:
   * Configure the IdP to log all SAML-related events, including token issuance and administrative activities.
   * Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to analyse these logs for suspicious patterns.
4. **Implement Conditional Access Policies**:
   * Enforce additional authentication measures for high-risk activities or privileged accounts using conditional access policies.
   * Limit access to sensitive applications based on user roles, devices, and locations.
5. **Hardening and Monitoring IdP**:
   * Apply the latest security patches and updates to the IdP to address known vulnerabilities.
   * Limit administrative access to the IdP and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts.
6. **Periodic Audits**:
   * Regularly review the configuration of the federated identity system for misconfigurations or unnecessary trust relationships.
   * Perform security assessments to ensure the integrity of the IdP and SP infrastructure.

***

Golden SAML attacks highlight the importance of securing identity infrastructure in federated environments. By implementing robust detection and mitigation techniques, organisations can reduce the risk of unauthorised access and maintain the integrity of their authentication processes.

### KQL Detection Queries

To detect a **Golden SAML** attack in Microsoft Sentinel or Azure Monitor, you can use the following **KQL** queries. These queries identify anomalies in Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token activities, such as tokens issued without corresponding authentication events or unusual administrative changes to the Identity Provider (IdP).

| extend SAMLToken = case(
    EventID == 4769, "Service Ticket Request",
    EventID == 4771, "Pre-authentication Failure",
    "Other")
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, Computer, IpAddress, SAMLToken, LogonType;

// Step 2: Identify token issuance without authentication
let UnlinkedSAMLTokens = SAMLTokenEvents
| summarize TokenCount = count() by AccountName, Computer, IpAddress
| where TokenCount > 1  // Detect repeated token activity
| join kind=leftanti (SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4624) on $left.AccountName == $right.AccountName;

// Step 3: Monitor administrative changes to the IdP
let IdPConfigChanges = SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 5136  // Directory object modification
| where ObjectClass in ("msDS-PrincipalName", "ServiceConnectionPoint")  // IdP-related objects

```
{% endcode %}

#### **How This Query Works**

1. **Monitor SAML Token Anomalies**:
   * Tracks Kerberos events (4768, 4769, 4771) to identify token issuance anomalies.
   * Highlights tokens issued without corresponding authentication (e.g., EventID 4624).
2. **Detect Repeated Token Use**:
   * Aggregates token activity for the same account and flags repeated activity, which might indicate forged tokens.
3. **Track IdP Configuration Changes**:
   * Focuses on directory changes related to the IdP, such as alterations to service principal names (SPNs) or Service Connection Points (SCPs).
4. **Correlation**:
   * Combines anomalies in token usage and configuration changes to surface potential Golden SAML attacks.

***

#### **Customisations**

* **Thresholds**: Adjust `TokenCount > 1` to suit your environment's baseline activity.
* **Include Specific Resources**: Add filters for high-value applications or services, such as AWS or Office 365.
* **Integrate UEBA**: Combine with user behaviour analysis to detect deviations from normal activity

| table _time, TargetUserName, ComputerName, IPs, TokenTypes, SuspiciousActions, count, UnusualCount
| sort - _time
```
{% endcode %}

#### **Explanation of Enhancements**

1. **Expanded Data Sources**:
   * Incorporates logs from Azure AD (`index=azuread`) and federated authentication systems (`index=federation`) alongside Kerberos logs.
   * Specifically looks for Event ID 1200 from federated authentication logs, which is associated with SAML-based logins.
2. **Token Usage Patterns**:
   * Tracks common Kerberos token events (`EventCode=4768, 4769, 4771`).
   * Monitors unusual federated authentication patterns (e.g., SAML tokens issued without interactive logins).
3. **IdP Configuration Changes**:
   * Monitors directory changes (`EventCode=5136`) related to IdP attributes such as SPNs, certificates, or service connection points.
4. **Suspicious Activity Evaluation**:
   * Flags:
     * SAML service ticket requests targeting non-standard accounts.
     * IdP configuration modifications that could indicate tampering.
     * Anomalous federated authentication behaviour (e.g., non-interactive SAML logins).
5. **Statistical Correlation**:
   * Aggregates activity by `TargetUserName` and associated IPs or token types.
   * Highlights accounts with repeated suspicious actions or unusually high activity.
6. **Dynamic Thresholding**:
   * Introduces a dynamic flag (`UnusualCount`) for accounts exceeding normal thresholds (`count > 3`).

***

#### **Customisations**

* **Federated Services**:
  * Add specific federation service logs if you use AWS, Office 365, or custom SAML providers.
* **Authentication Details**:
  * Modify `AuthDetails` filtering to include service-specific SAML token attributes.
* **Thresholds**:
  * Adjust thresholds (`count > 2`) based on normal activity in your environment.

***

#### **Usage**
