# Tshark

### Using TShark for PCAP Data Analysis in an Investigation

**TShark**, the command-line counterpart to Wireshark, is a powerful tool for analysing PCAP data when doing network forensic investigations. It provides detailed insights into network traffic, enabling analysts to uncover malicious activities and understand the scope of security incidents.&#x20;

Key benefits of using TShark include:

1. **Efficiency in Large-Scale Analysis**:
   * TShark can process large PCAP files quickly and efficiently, making it ideal for investigating high-volume network traffic without requiring a graphical interface.
2. **Granular Filtering and Queries**:
   * With its robust filtering options, TShark allows analysts to isolate specific traffic types, such as HTTP, DNS, or SMB, or focus on particular indicators like IP addresses, ports, or protocol flags.
3. **Customisable Output**:
   * Analysts can extract specific fields (e.g., timestamps, source/destination IPs, packet lengths) and export the data in formats like JSON, CSV, or plain text for further analysis or reporting.
4. **Protocol-Specific Insights**:
   * TShark decodes and interprets hundreds of protocols, making it easier to analyse the contents of application-layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, DNS, and TLS.
5. **Integration with Automation**:
   * Its command-line nature allows TShark to be integrated into scripts for automated analysis, such as detecting IoCs, extracting credentials, or monitoring traffic patterns.
6. **Forensic Applications**:
   * TShark can be used to reconstruct events, such as identifying command-and-control communication, detecting large file transfers (data exfiltration), or analysing malicious payloads.
7. **Reproducibility and Reporting**:
   * The ability to generate logs and export specific packets makes TShark a reliable tool for creating reproducible evidence and detailed investigative reports.

By leveraging TShark, investigators gain a precise, scalable, and scriptable tool for deep-diving into network traffic, identifying threats, and gathering actionable intelligence during cybersecurity investigations

Below is a set of **TShark** queries designed for forensic analysis of`.pcap` files, each accompanied by an explanation of its purpose. **TShark**, the command-line version of Wireshark, allows you to efficiently analyse network traffic for investigations.

***

### 1. Read **Basic Packet Information**

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap
```

* **Explanation**: Displays a summary of all packets in the pcap file. Use this as a starting point to get an overview of the traffic.

***

### 2. **Extract HTTP GET and POST Requests**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "http.request" -T fields -e http.host -e http.request.method -e http.request.uri
```
{% endcode %}

* **Explanation**: Extracts HTTP request methods (`GET`, `POST`), the hostnames, and URIs. This is useful for identifying malicious web requests or data exfiltration.

***

### 3. **Filter Traffic by IP Address**

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "ip.addr == 192.168.1.10"
```

* **Explanation**: Displays all packets involving a specific IP address (`192.168.1.10`). This isolates traffic related to a potentially compromised host.

***

### 4. **Filter DNS Queries**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "dns.qry.name" -T fields -e frame.time -e dns.qry.name
```
{% endcode %}

***

### 5. **Filter by Protocol**

*   **HTTP**:

    ```bash
    tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "http"
    ```
*   **TCP**:

    ```bash
    tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "tcp"
    ```

*   **FTP**:

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```bash
    tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "ftp.request.command == USER or ftp.request.command == PASS" -T fields -e ftp.request.command -e ftp.request.arg
    ```
    {% endcode %}
*   **HTTP Basic Auth**:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codetshark -r file.pcap -Y "http.authbasic" -T fields -e http.authbasic
    ```
* **Explanation**: Detects plaintext credentials in FTP or HTTP traffic.

***

### 9. **Analyse Command-and-Control (C2) Activity**

*   **HTTP-Based C2**:

    ```bash
    tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "http.request and ip.dst == 198.51.100.1"
    ```

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```bash
    tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "dns.qry.name and frame.len > 300" -T fields -e dns.qry.name -e frame.len
    ```
    {% endcode %}
* **Explanation**: Filters packets for C2 activity over HTTP or DNS. Replace the IP or payload length as needed.

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "ip.addr == 192.168.1.10" -w filtered.pcap
```

* **Explanation**: Filters traffic for a specific condition (e.g., an IP address) and writes it to a new `.pcap` file for focused analysis.

***

### 16. **Reassemble HTTP Objects**

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap --export-objects http,output_directory/
```

* **Explanation**: Extracts files transferred via HTTP. Useful for recovering potentially malicious payloads or identifying stolen data.

***

### <mark style="color:blue;">20.</mark> **Identify Traffic to Tor Nodes**

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -Y "tcp.port == 9001 or tcp.port == 9030"
```

* **Explanation**: Filters traffic to ports commonly associated with Tor entry or relay nodes, potentially indicating anonymised communication by ransomware.

***

### 21. **Detect Suspicious Packet Rates**

```bash
tshark -r sample.pcap -qz io,stat,1
```

* **Explanation**: Summarises packet counts per second. Spikes may indicate scanning, DDoS, or other anomalies.

***

#### Notes:

* Replace placeholders (e.g., `192.168.1.10`, `203.0.113.5`, `malicious.com`) with investigation-specific details.
* Use threat intelligence feeds to refine filters with known IoCs.

These TShark queries provide a toolkit for performing network forensics on pcap files, helping uncover malicious activities or other suspicious behaviours.
