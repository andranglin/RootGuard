# Junior Analyst Skills

### Junior SOC Personnel Requirements (Tier 1 Analysts):

**Technical Skills:** Junior SOC personnel, such as Tier 1 analysts, must possess foundational technical skills to serve as the first line of defence in a Security Operations Center. To recognise normal versus suspicious activity, they need a basic understanding of network fundamentals, including IP addressing, TCP/IP protocols, and standard ports (e.g., HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443). Familiarity with cybersecurity concepts like malware types (e.g., viruses, trojans), phishing techniques, and basic attack patterns equips them to identify potential threats at an entry-level.&#x20;

**Tools**: Their toolkit centers on essential monitoring and detection technologies, requiring proficiency with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms like Splunk or QRadar for basic alert monitoring and log review. They should be comfortable using antivirus software (e.g., Windows Defender, McAfee), firewalls, and ticketing systems (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira) to log and track incidents, ensuring they can handle initial triage with standard, user-friendly tools.

**Processes:** Junior analysts must follow well-defined processes to manage daily operations, including monitoring dashboards for alerts, documenting incidents according to SOC playbooks, and escalating issues based on predefined severity thresholds. They adhere to basic workflows—such as acknowledging alerts, conducting initial investigations, and closing low-risk cases—aligned with simplified versions of frameworks like NIST 800-61 or internal SOPs.&#x20;

**Incident Response Knowledge:** Their incident response knowledge is introductory, focusing on recognising common indicators of compromise (IOCs) like unusual login attempts, high network traffic, or known malicious IP addresses. They need to understand the steps to escalate incidents to Tier 2 when they exceed basic troubleshooting (e.g., quarantining a device or resetting a password), ensuring timely handoff without delving into complex analysis.&#x20;

**Additional Competencies:** Strong attention to detail is critical for spotting anomalies in logs or alerts, while basic communication skills—written for incident tickets and verbal for team handoffs—are essential for collaboration. They must work well in a structured, often shift-based environment, displaying a willingness to learn and adapt as they encounter new threats, with an openness to guidance from senior team members.
