# Discovery (TA0007) Techniques

### Introduction

Forensically investigating discovery techniques on workstations and server systems involves identifying how an attacker or malicious entity gathered information about your systems and network. Discovery is a tactic in the MITRE ATT\&CK framework that encompasses various techniques used by adversaries to gain knowledge about the system, network, and environment they have compromised.

#### Understanding Common Discovery Techniques

* **System and Network Discovery:** Identifying system configurations, network resources, and devices.
* **Account Discovery:** Gathering information about user accounts.
* **File and Directory Discovery:** Searching for files and directories of interest.
* **Software Discovery:** Identifying installed applications and software.
* **Command and Control Discovery:** Detecting communication with C\&C servers.

#### Data Collection and Preservation

* **Forensic Imaging:** Use tools like EnCase, AXIOM Cyber, FTK Imager or dd to create images of affected systems.
* **Memory Capture**: Employ tools like Magnet RAM Capture or WinPmem to capture volatile memory.
* **Log Collection:** Collect security logs, system logs, application logs, and command execution logs.

#### Log Analysis

* **Security and System Logs:** Look for signs of reconnaissance activities, such as frequent access to system information utilities or scripts.
* **Authentication Logs:** Check for unusual login attempts or user enumeration activities.
* **Network Logs:** Review logs for signs of network scanning or mapping activities.

#### File and Directory Analysis

* **File Access Logs:** Investigate logs for access to specific files or directories containing sensitive information.
* **File System Forensics:** Analyse file systems for tools or scripts that could be used in the discovery process.

#### Command History Analysis

* **Command Line Logs:** Windows systems log command line activity, including PowerShell, in Event Logs. Look for commands related to system reconnaissance (like netstat, ipconfig, whoami, and net commands).
* **Bash History (Unix/Linux):** Review .bash\_history or equivalent files for executed commands that could be used for discovery.

#### Network Traffic Analysis

* **Network Monitoring Tools:** Use tools like Wireshark or Tcpdump to analyse captured network traffic for reconnaissance patterns.
* **DNS Query Logs:** Review DNS logs for domain lookups that may indicate reconnaissance or mapping of internal resources.

#### Artifact Analysis

* **Prefetch Files (Windows):** Analyse Prefetch files to determine if any tools commonly used for discovery were executed.
* **Registry Analysis (Windows):** Check registry keys for traces of commands or tools execution.

#### Use of Specialised Forensic Tools

* **Forensic Suites:** Tools like EnCase, Autopsy, or X-Ways for comprehensive system analysis.
* **Sysinternals Suite (Windows):** Use tools like Process Monitor and Process Explorer for real-time system monitoring.

#### Documentation and Reporting

* **Detailed Documentation:** Record all findings, methodologies, and evidence paths.
* **Forensic Report:** Compile a comprehensive report detailing the investigation, findings, and potential impact.

#### Post-Investigation Actions

* **Mitigation and Remediation:** Implement necessary security measures to counter the identified discovery techniques.
* **Recovery:** Restore systems and data from backups where necessary.
* **Enhancing Defenses:** Update security policies and tools based on the findings.

#### Key Considerations

* Chain of Custody: Maintain a clear chain of custody for all evidence.
* Legal Compliance: Ensure the investigation is compliant with legal and organisational policies.
* Data Confidentiality: Handle all data securely, maintaining its confidentiality and integrity.

Each case of discovery by an attacker can be unique, requiring a tailored approach based on the specifics of the incident and the environment.
