# Intermediate and Advanced Skills

### Intermediate SOC Personnel Requirements:

**Technical Skills:** Intermediate SOC personnel, such as Tier 2 analysts, must possess a strong technical skillset that builds on cybersecurity basics. They need a solid grasp of network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS), common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, SQL injection, privilege escalation), and vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE listings) to investigate incidents effectively. Basic scripting skills in languages like Python, PowerShell, or Bash are essential for automating tasks like log parsing or report generation, enhancing their efficiency.&#x20;

**Tools:** Their toolkit includes advanced proficiency with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms such as Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel or ArcSight for log aggregation, correlation, and alert triage. Hands-on experience with intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) like Snort or Suricata and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools such as Defender, CrowdStrike or Carbon Black is critical for monitoring and analysing security events in real-time.&#x20;

**Processes:** Intermediate personnel must follow structured processes for incident handling, adhering to workflows—detection, containment, eradication, and recovery—aligned with frameworks like NIST 800-61 or SANS incident response steps. Familiarity with ticketing systems (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira) ensures efficient case tracking and management, maintaining an organised approach to resolving incidents.&#x20;

**Incident Response Knowledge:** Their incident response knowledge should cover malware behaviour, lateral movement, and post-exploitation tactics, enabling them to assess incidents and escalate critical cases appropriately. They need to perform root cause analysis and understand when an event exceeds their scope, ensuring timely handoff to higher tiers.&#x20;

**Additional Competencies:** Strong analytical thinking and attention to detail are vital for distinguishing genuine threats from false positives, while clear communication skills—written for incident reports and verbal for team updates—are non-negotiable. They must also work under moderate pressure and adapt to evolving threats, maintaining composure and flexibility in dynamic situations.&#x20;

### Advanced SOC Personnel Requirements (Senior SOC Analyst Level):

**Technical Skills:** Advanced SOC personnel, such as senior analysts or Tier 3 responders, require an expert-level technical skillset for tackling complex threats. This includes deep knowledge of cloud security (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), container technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), and attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK, applied to both defence and simulation scenarios.&#x20;

**Tools:** Their toolkit demands mastery of advanced tools: SIEMs for custom query and dashboard creation (e.g., Splunk, QRadar), Wireshark for packet analysis, Volatility or Autopsy for digital forensics, and IDA Pro or Ghidra for malware reverse-engineering. They also need proficiency with penetration testing tools (e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite) and vulnerability management platforms (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) to proactively address risks.&#x20;

**Processes:** Process expertise includes designing custom detection rules, integrating threat intelligence feeds (e.g., STIX/TAXII, MISP), and conducting proactive threat hunting to uncover hidden threats. They lead strategic initiatives like tool deployments or process audits, ensuring the SOC evolves with the threat landscape and aligning efforts with compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001).&#x20;

**Incident Response Knowledge:** Their incident response knowledge is extensive, covering advanced persistent threats (APTs), zero-day exploits, and insider threats, with the ability to lead end-to-end responses—prioritising containment, coordinating teams, and analysing forensic artifacts (e.g., memory dumps, disk images). They excel at root cause analysis and post-incident reviews to prevent recurrence.&#x20;

**Additional Competencies:** Leadership skills are critical for mentoring junior analysts, briefing executives, and shaping security policies, while strategic thinking and crisis management ensure success in high-stakes scenarios. A commitment to continuous learning—via certifications like CISSP, GCIH, GCFA, or OSCP—and vendor management (e.g., with MSSPs for SMEs) rounds out their profile, enabling them to balance tactical and long-term security goals under pressure.
