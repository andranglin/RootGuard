# Incident Response (IR)

## <mark style="color:blue;">**What is Cybersecurity Incident Response?**</mark>

Cybersecurity Incident Response (IR) refers to the structured approach to detecting, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches, malware attacks, and insider threats. The primary goal is to mitigate the impact of an incident, reduce downtime, and safeguard sensitive data and infrastructure.

Incident response is guided by frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which outlines key phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Skillset Required for an Incident Response Analyst**</mark>

Incident response analysts are the first line of defence against cyber threats. To excel in this role, a blend of technical, analytical, and communication skills is essential:

1. **Technical Skills**:
   * Expertise in analysing logs from systems, applications, and network devices.
   * Proficiency in cybersecurity tools like SIEMs (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel), EDR solutions (e.g., CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender), and packet analysers (e.g., Tcpdump, Wireshark, NetWitness, NetFlow, Snort).
   * Knowledge of malware analysis, reverse engineering, and threat hunting.
   * Familiarity with scripting languages such as Python, PowerShell, or Bash for automating tasks.
   * Understanding of system administration (Windows/Linux) and networking concepts.
2. **Analytical Skills**:
   * Ability to identify patterns and anomalies in data.
   * Strong problem-solving skills to determine the root cause of incidents.
   * Logical thinking for correlating evidence and formulating conclusions.
3. **Soft Skills**:
   * Effective communication to explain technical findings to non-technical stakeholders.
   * Collaboration skills for working with cross-functional teams during incidents.
   * Stress management to maintain focus during high-pressure situations.
4. **Knowledge of Frameworks and Protocols**:
   * Familiarity with MITRE ATT\&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, and other threat modelling frameworks.
   * Understanding compliance requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, NIS2, and PCI DSS.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Tasks and Responsibilities of an Incident Response Analyst**</mark>

Incident response analysts perform various critical tasks to ensure the organisation remains secure against evolving threats. Key responsibilities include:

1. **Preparation**:
   * Developing and maintaining an incident response plan.
   * Establishing baselines for normal system and network behaviour.
   * Conducting tabletop exercises and penetration tests to assess readiness.
2. **Detection and Analysis**:
   * Monitoring systems for suspicious activities using logs, alerts, and behavioural analytics.
   * Investigating alerts to identify false positives and true incidents.
   * Assessing the scope and impact of confirmed incidents.
3. **Containment**:
   * Isolating affected systems to prevent the spread of threats.
   * Implementing temporary measures to block malicious activities.
4. **Eradication**:
   * Removing malware or unauthorised access.
   * Patching vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that enabled the attack.
5. **Recovery**:
   * Restoring affected systems and verifying they are secure.
   * Ensuring normal operations resume without risk of reinfection.
6. **Post-Incident Review**:
   * Documenting findings, actions taken, and lessons learned.
   * Proposing improvements to the incident response plan and security posture.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Training and Certifications Required**</mark>

Training and certifications demonstrate expertise and build trust in an analyst’s capabilities. Here are some of the most recognised certifications:

1. **EC-Council Certified Incident Handler (ECIH):**
   * This is a good starting point for beginners as it teaches candidates how to detect, contain, and respond to incidents and address post-breach issues.
2. **Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)**:
   * Focuses on detecting, responding to, and resolving security incidents.
3. **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**:
   * Provides a broad understanding of cybersecurity principles, including incident management.
4. **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**:
   * Covers ethical hacking techniques to understand and counteract malicious tactics.
5. **GIAC Experienced Incident Handler Certification (GX-IH):**
   * &#x20;Demonstrates a candidate's ability to use attacker techniques, incident response tools, and practices.
6. **SANS Incident Response & Threat Hunting (FOR508)**:
   * Focuses on advanced incident response and forensic techniques.
7. **CompTIA CySA+**:
   * Emphasises threat detection, risk mitigation, and incident response.
8. **Splunk Certified User/Analyst**:
   * Enhances skills in leveraging SIEM platforms for incident detection and response.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Path to Becoming an Incident Response Analyst**</mark>

1. **Educational Foundation**:
   * Obtain a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity, computer science, or information technology.
   * Pursue a master’s degree in cybersecurity or a related field for advanced roles.
2. **Gaining Practical Experience**:
   * Intern with organisations offering cybersecurity roles.
   * Participate in cybersecurity competitions, CTF challenges, and online labs.
3. **Certifications**:
   * Acquire certifications relevant to incident response to build expertise and credibility.
4. **Building Hands-On Skills**:
   * Gain experience with tools and techniques in sandbox environments.
   * Practice creating and responding to simulated incidents.
5. **Networking and Community Engagement**:
   * Join forums and organisations like (ISC)², SANS, or local cybersecurity meetups.
   * Attend industry conferences like Black Hat or DEF CON to stay updated on trends.
6. **Continuous Learning**:
   * Keep up with the latest threat landscapes, attack techniques, and defensive strategies.
   * Regularly update skills through online platforms like Cybrary, TryHackMe, or Hack The Box.

By following a structured and well-defined pathway and maintaining a commitment to continuous improvement, aspiring professionals can establish themselves as effective and sought-after incident response analysts.
