# KQL for Defender & Sentinel

### Introduction

KQL (Kusto Query Language) is a powerful tool used in Microsoft Defender and Sentinel to investigate security incidents, analyse logs, and extract actionable insights from large datasets. It allows security analysts to query data stored in Log Analytics workspaces, which collect logs from various sources such as endpoints, networks, and cloud environments. KQL is designed to be intuitive and efficient, enabling users to filter, aggregate, and visualise data in real-time. Common use cases include hunting for threats, identifying anomalies, and correlating events across different data sources. Its flexibility makes it a cornerstone of modern security operations, particularly in environments leveraging Microsoft's security ecosystem.

In Defender for Endpoint and Sentinel, KQL is used to create custom detection rules, perform advanced threat hunting, and automate responses. For example, analysts can write queries to detect suspicious processes, identify lateral movement attempts, or uncover malicious file executions. KQL queries can also be integrated into Sentinel's playbooks to automate incident response workflows. The language supports a wide range of operators and functions, such as `where`, `summarize`, `join`, and `extend`, which allows for complex data manipulation and analysis. Additionally, KQL's ability to handle time-series data is particularly useful for tracking the progression of attacks and understanding the timeline of security incidents.

Learning KQL is essential for security professionals working with Defender and Sentinel, as it enhances their ability to investigate and mitigate threats effectively. Microsoft provides extensive documentation, sample queries, and interactive tutorials to help users get started. Mastery of KQL enables analysts to move beyond prebuilt detections and create tailored queries that address specific organisational needs. As cyber threats continue to evolve, KQL remains a critical skill for proactive threat hunting, incident response, and overall security posture improvement in modern SOC (Security Operations Center) environments.
