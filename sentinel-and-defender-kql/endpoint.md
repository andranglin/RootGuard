# Endpoint

### Introduction

**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** is an enterprise-grade security platform designed to protect, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats across endpoints in a corporate network. It leverages a combination of advanced threat intelligence, behavioural analysis, and cloud-powered machine learning to deliver comprehensive endpoint protection. Defender for Endpoint provides real-time monitoring and protection against malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Its key features include endpoint detection and response (EDR), threat and vulnerability management, automated investigation and remediation, attack surface reduction, and integration with Microsoft security tools such as Azure Sentinel and Defender for Cloud.

This platform supports proactive threat hunting by providing security analysts with detailed insights into suspicious activities, endpoint telemetry, and potential compromises through a user-friendly dashboard. Defender for Endpoint integrates with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, offering a clear view of adversary tactics and techniques. The solution is cloud-native, ensuring scalability and seamless updates while also providing compatibility with Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android devices. Organisations can utilise its rich set of APIs to integrate with third-party security tools and extend its capabilities. With Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, businesses can strengthen their security posture, reduce response times, and minimise the risk of breaches in an ever-evolving threat landscape.

The following is a set of KQL queries that can be used to detect and analyse malicious or suspicious activities in your environment. The queries are designed to quickly grab the necessary information that will allow the investigator to determine whether the activity warrants deeper analysis or escalation.

**Note**: On some occasions, hopefully, at a minimum, the investigator will have to customise the queries for the environment where they are being used. Queries will only work if the data is available.

### Detect Local User Account Creation on Endpoint

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) // Analyze events from the past 7 days
| where ActionType == "UserAccountCreated" // Filter events where user accounts are created
| where AccountName != "defaultuser1" // Exclude default system-created accounts
| extend 
    AccountDomain = tostring(AccountDomain), // Extract domain of the created account
    ActorDomain = tostring(InitiatingProcessAccountDomain) // Domain of the actor initiating the action
| project 
    TimeGenerated, // Timestamp of the event
    DeviceName, // Device where the account was created
    ['Account Created Name'] = AccountName, // Name of the created account
    AccountDomain, // Domain of the created account
    Actor = InitiatingProcessAccountName, // Account initiating the process
    ActorDomain, // Domain of the actor account
    ActionType // Type of action taken
| order by TimeGenerated desc // Sort by most recent events
```
{% endcode %}

### Detecting Anomalous RDP Connections

**Use Case:** This query is designed to detect anomalous RDP activity in your environment, potentially indicating lateral movement or brute force attempts. By excluding known legitimate processes and focusing on private IPs, the query ensures that it highlights significant anomalies for further investigation.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
// Define parameters
let starttime = 30d; // Analysis window for anomaly detection
let timeframe = 2h; // Time bin for summarization
let sensitivity = 3; // Sensitivity for anomaly detection
let threshold = 2; // Minimum RDP events threshold for anomaly consideration
// Identify devices with anomalous RDP activity
let outlierdevices = 
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(starttime) // Filter events within the analysis window
    | where LocalIPType == "Private" // Focus on private IPs
    | where RemotePort == "3389" // Filter for RDP activity
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName != "Microsoft.Tri.Sensor.exe" // Exclude known legitimate processes
    | summarize RDPEvents = count() by DeviceName, bin(TimeGenerated, timeframe) // Summarize RDP activity by device and time bin
    | where RDPEvents > threshold // Filter devices with high RDP activity
    | summarize 
        EventCount = make_list(RDPEvents), // Collect event counts over time
        TimeGenerated = make_list(TimeGenerated) // Collect time bins
        by DeviceName
    | extend outliers = series_decompose_anomalies(EventCount, sensitivity) // Perform anomaly detection
    | mv-expand TimeGenerated, EventCount, outliers // Expand lists for detailed analysis
    | where outliers == 1 // Filter for anomalous events
    | distinct DeviceName; // Get unique list of devices with anomalies
// Analyze detailed RDP activity for anomalous devices and display in a table
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(starttime) // Filter events within the analysis window
| where DeviceName in (outlierdevices) // Focus on anomalous devices
| where LocalIPType == "Private" // Focus on private IPs
| where RemotePort == "3389" // Filter for RDP activity
| where InitiatingProcessFileName != "Microsoft.Tri.Sensor.exe" // Exclude known legitimate processes
| summarize 
    RDPCount = count(), // Total RDP activity count
    TimeRange = make_list(bin(TimeGenerated, timeframe)), // Collect time bins for activity
    IPAddresses = make_set(RemoteIP), // Collect unique remote IP addresses
    ProcessNames = make_set(InitiatingProcessFileName), // Collect initiating process file names
    InitiatingAccount = make_set(InitiatingProcessAccountName) // Collect user accounts initiating RDP
    by DeviceName // Group by device
| project 
    DeviceName, // Name of the device
    InitiatingAccount, // List of accounts initiating the activity
    RDPCount, // Total RDP activity count

### Detect Signs of Privilege Escalation

**Use Cases:** Detect Privilege Escalation: Identify accounts or processes attempting to elevate privileges. Proactive Threat Hunting: Uncover patterns of suspicious behavior indicative of privilege escalation. Incident Response: Correlate detected events with other indicators of compromise. Audit and Compliance: Monitor for unauthorized privilege changes.

### Detect Suspicious PowerShell Activity

### Detect Suspicious WMI Activity with Remote IPs

**Use Cases:** Detect Lateral Movement: Identify potential misuse of WMIC.exe for lateral movement within a network. Proactive Threat Hunting: Investigate WMI commands making connections to remote IPs. Incident Response: Correlate WMI activity with suspicious remote connections for further analysis. Filter Noise: Automatically exclude localhost and private IPs to focus on external connections.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
// Define the IP regex pattern
let IPRegex = @"[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}";
// Query to detect WMI usage with remote IPs
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d) // Analyze events from the last 30 days (adjust as needed)
| where FileName =~ "WMIC.exe" // Focus on WMI command-line executions
| extend RemoteIP = extract(IPRegex, 0, ProcessCommandLine) // Extract remote IPs from the command line
| where isnotempty(RemoteIP) // Only include entries with valid extracted IPs
| where not(RemoteIP in~ ("127.0.0.1", "::1")) // Exclude localhost IPs
| extend IsPrivateIP = ipv4_is_private(RemoteIP) // Identify private IPs
| extend IsSuspiciousIP = not(IsPrivateIP) // Flag non-private IPs as suspicious
| project 
    TimeGenerated, // Event timestamp
    DeviceName, // Name of the device where WMI was executed
    ProcessCommandLine, // Full command line of the WMI execution
    RemoteIP, // Extracted remote IP address
    IsPrivateIP, // Whether the IP is private
    IsSuspiciousIP // Whether the IP is flagged as suspicious
| order by TimeGenerated desc; // Sort results by the most recent events
```
