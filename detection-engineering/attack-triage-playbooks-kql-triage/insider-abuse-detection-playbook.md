# Insider Abuse Detection Playbook

### Introduction: The Need for Effective Insider Abuse Detection Capabilities

Insider threats pose a unique and complex challenge to organisations, as they originate from individuals with legitimate access to systems, data, and critical assets. Insider abuse—whether intentional or unintentional—can lead to data leaks, intellectual property theft, financial fraud, and operational sabotage. Malicious insiders may exploit their access to bypass security controls, while negligent employees may inadvertently expose sensitive information through misconfigurations or weak security practices. Given the growing reliance on cloud environments, remote work, and third-party collaborations, detecting and mitigating insider threats has become more critical than ever.

Effective insider abuse detection capabilities and processes are essential to identifying suspicious activities before they escalate into security incidents. A comprehensive detection strategy should integrate user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA), identity and access monitoring, anomaly detection, and real-time log correlation through Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools further enhance visibility into unauthorised data access, privilege misuse, and anomalous file transfers.

To stay ahead of insider threats, organisations must implement continuous monitoring, risk-based access controls, and automated alerts tailored to insider activity. Additionally, a strong security culture with employee training, periodic access reviews, and well-defined response protocols can help mitigate risks. By strengthening detection capabilities and response processes, organisations can proactively address insider abuse, protect sensitive data, and maintain trust and operational security.

This playbook outlines advanced techniques for detecting and analysing insider abuse across an organisation using KQL queries for Microsoft Defender and Sentinel. Each section provides multiple query options, detailed descriptions, and expected outcomes.

### 1. **Initial Detection of Insider Abuse**

#### Query Option 1: Monitor Unusual File Access

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where ActionType in ("FileRead", "FileCopied", "FileDeleted")
| where FolderPath contains "Sensitive" or FolderPath contains "Confidential"
| summarize FileAccessCount = count() by DeviceName, AccountName, FolderPath
| where FileAccessCount > 10
| project DeviceName, AccountName, FolderPath, FileAccessCount
```

**Description:** Identifies unusual access to sensitive or confidential file locations. Results display user accounts, devices, and accessed file paths.

#### Query Option 2: Detect Suspicious Privileged Account Activity

```kusto
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where UserPrincipalName endswith "<privileged_domain>"
| summarize LoginCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where LoginCount > 5
| project UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, LoginCount
```

**Description:** Tracks privileged accounts with repeated logins from the same IP, potentially indicating abuse. Results highlight accounts and IPs.

#### Query Option 3: Identify Abnormal Login Patterns

```kusto
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where Location != "<expected_location>"
| summarize LoginCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, Location, IPAddress
| where LoginCount > 1
| project UserPrincipalName, Location, IPAddress, LoginCount
```

**Description:** Detects logins from unexpected geolocations. Results include user accounts, login locations, and IP addresses.

***

### 2. **Sensitive Data Access and Exfiltration**

#### Query Option 1: Detect Large File Transfers

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where BytesSent > 10000000
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteIPAddress, BytesSent
```

**Description:** Flags large outbound data transfers that could indicate data exfiltration. Results display devices and remote IPs.

#### Query Option 2: Monitor Cloud Storage Uploads

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where RemoteDnsDomain contains_any ("amazonaws.com", "blob.core.windows.net", "googleapis.com")
| summarize TotalBytesSent = sum(BytesSent) by DeviceName, RemoteDnsDomain
| where TotalBytesSent > 5000000
| project DeviceName, RemoteDnsDomain, TotalBytesSent
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Tracks significant data uploads to cloud storage services. Results highlight devices, domains, and data volumes.

#### Query Option 3: Identify Potential Data Exfiltration via Email

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where RecipientDomain != "<organization_domain>" and SenderEmailAddress contains "<sensitive_keywords>"
| summarize EmailCount = count() by SenderEmailAddress, RecipientDomain
| where EmailCount > 5
| project SenderEmailAddress, RecipientDomain, EmailCount
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Detects emails sent to external domains with sensitive keywords, indicating potential exfiltration. Results include sender and recipient details.

***

### 3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**

#### Query Option 1: Track Unusual Process Execution

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| where ProcessCommandLine contains_any ("whoami", "net user", "nltest")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine, AccountName
```
{% endcode %}

**Description:** Flags commands commonly used to enumerate accounts and privileges. Results include the device and account executing the commands.

#### Query Option 2: Detect Privilege Escalation Attempts

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where ProcessCommandLine matches regex @"(\\bexploit\\b|\\belevate\\b|\\bprivilege\\b)"

### 6. **Conclusion**

The playbook offers a good approach to detecting and analysing compromises in an environment. However, its usefulness depends on the environment and tools at your disposal. For an environment where KQL is an option, the queries may require some adaptation to specific data sources and infrastructure setup.
