# About the Author

### Who Am I?

I am an Information and Cybersecurity Professional specialising in the intersection of offensive and defensive operations. My core focus lies in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), Threat Hunting, and Cloud Security.

My journey into security began in Network Engineering. This infrastructure background is the foundation of my approach: I believe you cannot effectively secure or attack a system unless you deeply understand the architecture, protocols, and traffic patterns that power it.

Today, I leverage that experience to bridge the gap between IT operations and security architecture, managing complex security operations and implementing enterprise-grade solutions for hybrid environments.

### The Purpose of RootGuard

I built RootGuard to be the resource I wish I had when I was transitioning from networking to security.

It serves as my operational repository—a place to document the methodologies, tools, and processes I have honed through real-world experience.&#x20;

It is designed for fellow practitioners: SOC managers, Cloud Engineers, and technical leaders who need actionable tradecraft rather than high-level theory.

**My goal is to foster a resilient community by sharing:**

* **Operational Reality:** Tactics that work in production environments, not just in labs.
* **Attribution & Respect:** Cybersecurity is a collective effort. I use this space to highlight and credit the researchers and engineers whose work has shaped my own understanding.
* **Continuous Evolution:** The threat landscape shifts daily. This platform reflects my commitment to continuous learning in areas like AI-driven threats and Zero Trust architecture.

### What You Will Find Here

* **Operational Tradecraft:** Detailed playbooks for DFIR workflows and offensive techniques.
* **Strategic Analysis:** Deep dives into supply chain risks, AI threat mitigation, and regulatory compliance.
* **Visual Resources:** Architecture diagrams (Zero Trust, Threat Intel workflows) and framework mappings (MITRE ATT\&CK, NIST).
