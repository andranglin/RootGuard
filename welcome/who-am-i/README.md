# Who Am I?

Hi, I'm Adrian Anglin. I'm an Information and Cyber Security Professional interested in offensive and defensive security operations. These days, most of my time is spent doing Digital Forensics, Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and other operational areas within InfoSec. My journey into the tech space started as a Network Engineer, and some years later, I moved into InfoSec. Feel free to checkout my [Professional Profile](professional-profile.md)

Over the years, I have studied various areas of information and cybersecurity and earned several degrees and professional certifications. I am a cybersecurity enthusiast at heart and a continuous learner. The reason for setting up this site is to share my experiences and the content of other professionals whose work has been helpful in my development. Thanks to all the other professionals who have shared their expertise and knowledge with the broader community.&#x20;

My passion and interest in information technology and security go beyond my own employment, and therefore, I wanted to:

* A place to publish some of my learning outcomes to help others improve their skills, knowledge, and processes relating to information and cyber security.
* Lower the barrier of entry for upcoming security professionals who are interested in entering the field but lack the knowledge and skills.
* And finally, a place to consolidate and publish some of my achievements and the thought process that led to them.

The aim is to provide some theoretical and practical approaches to help others delve deeper into the more common tools and technology. The content on the site reflects the tools, processes, and methodologies I have used and am familiar with. It's impossible to cover all areas at a level appropriate for everyone, so in the areas of focus, I will reference other online resources that I think may be helpful. On these occasions, I will attribute the appropriate credit and request that you support their work. A significant part of our field is the willingness of others to share their research, knowledge and expertise; let's help them so their work continues.

### Why should anyone listen to me?

My area of knowledge isn't focused on a single area within the technology space, nor am I an expert; what I am is a continuous learner and someone who has invested time into my development and has gained a considerable amount of experience working in multiple areas with information technology. In my professional career and spare time, I have undertaken multiple successful technology implementations, achieving the goals based on agreed objectives. As part of the day job, managed day-to-day information and cyber security operations and implemented organisational cyber initiatives.
