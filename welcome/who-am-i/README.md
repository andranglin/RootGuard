# Who Am I?

A seasoned Information and Cybersecurity Professional specialising in offensive and defensive operations, including Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), threat hunting, and cloud security. With a background as a Network Engineer, I transitioned into cybersecurity, bringing years of experience in managing complex security operations and implementing enterprise-grade solutions. My work encompasses DFIR, threat intelligence, and operational security, grounded in a commitment to continuous learning and adherence to industry best practices.

### My Mission

RootGuard is my platform for sharing expertise, insights, and practical resources with the cybersecurity community. Designed for experienced professionals—such as SOC managers, CISOs, cloud security engineers, and IT leaders—this site focuses on high-impact areas, including threat hunting, incident response, and zero-trust architectures. My goal is to provide actionable knowledge, from technical playbooks to strategic guidance, to help you navigate sophisticated threats such as AI-driven attacks, supply chain vulnerabilities, and regulatory complexity.

I'm passionate about contributing to a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem by sharing methodologies, tools, and processes I've honed through real-world experience. RootGuard also serves as a space to highlight the work of other professionals whose insights have shaped my journey, with proper attribution to their contributions. By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, I aim to elevate cybersecurity standards and support the community's collective growth.

### What to Expect

* Expert Insights: In-depth analysis of current trends, including AI-powered threat mitigation, supply chain risk management, and zero-trust strategies.
* Technical Playbooks: Detailed guides on DFIR workflows, offensive security techniques, and tools of the trade.
* Practical Resources: Tool comparisons, frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK, NIST 800-207), and diagrams (e.g., zero-trust architectures, threat intelligence workflows) to support implementation.

### Why RootGuard?

My expertise is built on years of hands-on experience across diverse cybersecurity domains, from network defence to incident response. Rather than claiming mastery in a single area, I offer a broad perspective shaped by continuous learning and practical application. RootGuard reflects the tools, processes, and methodologies I've used successfully in enterprise environments, complemented by references to valuable community resources, credited to their creators. My goal is to deliver concise, actionable content that acknowledges the complexity of our field while fostering collaboration.
