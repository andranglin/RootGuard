# Professional Profile

**Name:** Adrian Anglin\
**Role:** _Cybersecurity Manager | Security Strategy & Governance | Technical Leader_\
**Location:** London, UK

### Professional Summary

I am a Cybersecurity Manager with over a decade of experience bridging the gap between technical security operations and organisational risk strategy.

Unlike many in management who step away from the technology, I maintain deep technical fluency in offensive and defensive operations. This allows me to lead with authority—designing pragmatic security architectures, managing high-performance SOC teams, and translating complex technical threats into clear business risks for executive stakeholders.

Currently, I lead security initiatives that do not just "lock down" systems but enable business objectives by ensuring resilience, compliance, and operational continuity in hybrid cloud environments.

#### Certifications

I hold industry-standard credentials that validate both my management capabilities and technical expertise.
