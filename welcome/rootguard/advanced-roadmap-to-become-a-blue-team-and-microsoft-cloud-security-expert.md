  * Identity Protection: Configure Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM) with time-bound roles, Conditional Access with risk-based triggers, and Entra ID Protection to detect sophisticated threats like token replay or anomalous sign-ins.
  * Automation: Script PowerShell for automated threat responses (e.g., revoke sessions after detecting credential stuffing).
  * Practice: Simulate advanced attacks (e.g., service principal abuse or lateral movement via Azure RBAC) in a lab, mitigating with Sentinel and Defender.
  * Advanced Resources:
