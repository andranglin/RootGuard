# About the Author

### Who Am I?

I am an Information and Cybersecurity Professional specialising in the intersection of offensive and defensive operations. My core focus lies in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), Threat Hunting, and Cloud Security.

My journey into security began in Network Engineering. This infrastructure background is the foundation of my approach: I believe you cannot effectively secure or attack a system unless you deeply understand the architecture, protocols, and traffic patterns that power it.

Today, I leverage that experience to bridge the gap between IT operations and security architecture, managing complex security operations and implementing enterprise-grade solutions for hybrid environments.

### The Purpose of RootGuard

I built RootGuard to be the resource I wish I had when I was transitioning from networking to security.

It serves as my operational repository—a place to document the methodologies, tools, and processes I have honed through real-world experience. It is designed for fellow practitioners: SOC managers, Cloud Engineers, and technical leaders who need actionable tradecraft rather than high-level theory.

My goal is to foster a resilient community by sharing:

* Operational Reality: Tactics that work in production environments, not just in labs.
* Attribution & Respect: Cybersecurity is a collective effort. I use this space to highlight and credit the researchers and engineers whose work has shaped my own understanding.
* Continuous Evolution: The threat landscape shifts daily. This platform reflects my commitment to continuous learning in areas like AI-driven threats and Zero Trust architecture.

### What You Will Find Here

* Operational Tradecraft: Detailed playbooks for DFIR workflows and offensive techniques.
* Strategic Analysis: Deep dives into supply chain risks, AI threat mitigation, and regulatory compliance.
* Visual Resources: Architecture diagrams (Zero Trust, Threat Intel workflows) and framework mappings (MITRE ATT\&CK, NIST).

### My Mission

RootGuard is my platform for sharing expertise, insights, and practical resources with the cybersecurity community. Designed for experienced professionals—such as SOC managers, CISOs, cloud security engineers, and IT leaders—this site focuses on high-impact areas, including threat hunting, incident response, and zero-trust architectures. My goal is to provide actionable knowledge, from technical playbooks to strategic guidance, to help you navigate sophisticated threats such as AI-driven attacks, supply chain vulnerabilities, and regulatory complexity.

I'm passionate about contributing to a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem by sharing methodologies, tools, and processes I've honed through real-world experience. RootGuard also serves as a space to highlight the work of other professionals whose insights have shaped my journey, with proper attribution to their contributions. By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, I aim to elevate cybersecurity standards and support the community's collective growth.

### What to Expect

* Expert Insights: In-depth analysis of current trends, including AI-powered threat mitigation, supply chain risk management, and zero-trust strategies.
* Technical Playbooks: Detailed guides on DFIR workflows, offensive security techniques, and tools of the trade.
* Practical Resources: Tool comparisons, frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK, NIST 800-207), and diagrams (e.g., zero-trust architectures, threat intelligence workflows) to support implementation.

### Why RootGuard?

My expertise is built on years of hands-on experience across diverse cybersecurity domains, from network defence to incident response. Rather than claiming mastery in a single area, I offer a broad perspective shaped by continuous learning and practical application. RootGuard reflects the tools, processes, and methodologies I've used successfully in enterprise environments, complemented by references to valuable community resources, credited to their creators. My goal is to deliver concise, actionable content that acknowledges the complexity of our field while fostering collaboration.
