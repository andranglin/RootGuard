# Malware Analysis

## <mark style="color:blue;">**What is Malware Analysis?**</mark>

Malware analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behaviour, purpose, and impact. This discipline is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, aiding in the detection, mitigation, and prevention of malware attacks. By dissecting malware, analysts provide valuable insights into its design and capabilities, allowing organisations to fortify their defences and develop countermeasures.

Malware analysis is categorised into four primary techniques:

1. **Static Analysis**: Examines malware without executing it, focusing on file attributes, strings, and disassembled code.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Observe malware behaviour in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox.
3. **Code Analysis**: Involves reverse-engineering malware to understand its source code and logic.
4. **Memory Analysis**: Investigates memory dumps to detect malicious activity and artifacts.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Skillset Required for a Malware Analyst**</mark>

Becoming a proficient malware analyst requires a blend of technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and curiosity. Below are the essential skills:

1. **Technical Skills**:
   * Proficiency in programming languages, particularly low-level languages like C, C++, and assembly, and scripting languages like Python.
   * In-depth understanding of operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and their internals.
   * Familiarity with disassembly tools (e.g., IDA Pro, Ghidra) and debugging tools (e.g., OllyDbg, x64dbg).
   * Knowledge of networking protocols and traffic analysis using tools like Wireshark and tcpdump.
   * Expertise in virtualisation and sandboxing for dynamic analysis.
2. **Analytical Skills**:
   * Strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
   * Ability to identify patterns and deduce the purpose of malicious code.
   * Keen attention to detail for detecting subtle anomalies.
3. **Soft Skills**:
   * Clear communication to present findings to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
   * Collaboration skills for working with incident response and threat intelligence teams.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Tasks and Responsibilities of a Malware Analyst**</mark>

Malware analysts are instrumental in combating cyber threats. Their core responsibilities include:

1. **Malware Investigation**:
   * Analysing suspicious files to determine their nature (malicious, benign, or false positives).
   * Identifying malware families and understanding their common traits.
2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   * Monitoring malware execution in isolated environments to observe its behaviour.
   * Extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names.
3. **Reverse Engineering**:
   * Deconstructing malware binaries to uncover their functionality and command structures.
   * Identifying exploits, payloads, and persistence mechanisms.
4. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   * Preparing detailed reports on malware capabilities and potential impacts.
   * Sharing findings with incident response teams and security stakeholders.
5. **Tool Development**:
   * Creating or enhancing tools for automated malware detection and analysis.
   * Developing scripts to streamline repetitive tasks.
6. **Threat Intelligence Collaboration**:
   * Sharing analysis results with threat intelligence communities.
   * Contributing to malware signature databases.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Training and Certifications Required**</mark>

Specialised training and certifications validate malware analysts' expertise and open doors to advanced opportunities. Key certifications include:

1. **GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM)**:
   * Focuses on reverse engineering and analysing malicious code.
2. **Certified Malware Analyst (CMA)**:
   * Provides comprehensive training on malware analysis techniques.
3. **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)**:
   * Covers penetration testing and exploit analysis, which is valuable for understanding malware.
4. **SANS FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware**:
   * A detailed course on advanced malware analysis.
5. **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**:
   * Teaches foundational skills in hacking and malware exploitation.
6. **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**:
   * Offers a broad understanding of security principles, including malware mitigation.
