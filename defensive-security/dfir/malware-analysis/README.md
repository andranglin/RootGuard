# Malware Analysis

## Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering

#### Deconstruct the Threat. Engineer the Defence.

Malware analysis is no longer a niche discipline reserved for researchers in ivory towers. It is a critical operational requirement for the modern Blue Team.

In a landscape dominated by polymorphic ransomware and custom C2 frameworks, relying on automated sandbox reports is a liability. To truly defend the network, you must possess the capability to dissect the adversary's tooling, understand their logic, and turn their own code against them.

### The Strategic Imperative

Why must a SOC Analyst or Incident Responder learn to reverse engineer?

* Beyond the Sandbox: Automated sandboxes can be evaded. EDR can be bypassed. When the "Black Box" fails, manual analysis is the only path to ground truth.
* Attribution & Intelligence: Understanding _how_ a binary works reveals _who_ built it. Code similarities track threat actors across campaigns.
* Detection Engineering: You cannot detect what you do not understand. Analysis allows you to move from fragile hash-based blocking to robust behavioural detection and high-fidelity YARA rules.
* Immediate Impact Assessment: During an active breach, waiting 48 hours for a vendor report is not an option. You need to know—right now—what the malware steals, who it talks to, and how it persists.

### Core Competencies

Effective malware analysis requires a tiered skill set, moving from rapid triage to deep-dive disassembly.

#### 1. Rapid Triage (The First Hour)

* Skill: Quickly extracting IOCs (IPs, Domains, Hashes) without executing the file.
* Objective: Immediate containment and blocking at the perimeter.
* Techniques: String extraction, PE header analysis, entropy checking for packing.

#### 2. Behavioural Analysis (Dynamic)

* Skill: Monitoring malware execution in a controlled environment to map its lifecycle.
* Objective: Understanding the "Kill Chain"—persistence mechanisms, lateral movement attempts, and C2 beacons.
* Techniques: API hooking, process monitoring, traffic interception (PCAP).

#### 3. Code Reversing (Static)

* Skill: Reading Assembly (x86/x64) and decompiled C code to understand logic flow.
* Objective: Defeating obfuscation, unpacking payloads, and finding hidden capabilities not triggered during dynamic analysis.
* Techniques: Disassembly, control flow graph analysis, stack frame reconstruction.

#### 4. Weaponisation (Detection)

* Skill: Translating analysis findings into defensive signatures.
* Objective: Immunising the network against the specific variant and its future iterations.
* Techniques: Writing YARA rules, Sigma rules, and Suricata signatures.

### From Binary to Defence

The ultimate goal of analysis is not a report—it is a stronger defence. RootGuard emphasises the operational loop:

1. Isolate the sample from the incident.
2. Dissect the sample to extract "Config" (C2 domains, encryption keys).
3. Develop a YARA rule based on unique code or string patterns.
4. Deploy the rule to hunt for other infections across the enterprise.
