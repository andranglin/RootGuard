# Initial Triage & Response

## Incident Response Analyst

First responders to cyber incidents—detecting, containing, and eradicating threats before they cause catastrophic damage.

***

### What is Incident Response?

A structured approach to handling security incidents: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Guided by frameworks like NIST 800-61 and aligned to MITRE ATT\&CK for threat context.

### Career Path

**Entry points:**

* SOC Analyst (Tier 1/2) → IR Analyst
* IT/System Admin → Security Operations → IR
* Help Desk → SOC → IR (longer path, but common)

**Build skills through:**

* CTFs and labs (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, CyberDefenders, LetsDefend)
* Home lab environments (DVWA, DetectionLab, YOURITS-Lab)
* Vendor training (Splunk, Microsoft, CrowdStrike free tiers)
* Community engagement (local meetups, BSides, Blue Team Village)

**Progression:**

* IR Analyst → Senior IR → IR Lead/Manager
* IR Analyst → Threat Hunter → Detection Engineer
* IR Analyst → DFIR Specialist → Forensic Examiner

***

### Quick Start

1. **Learn the fundamentals** — Networking, Windows/Linux, log analysis
2. **Get hands-on** — TryHackMe SOC Level 1, LetsDefend IR paths
3. **Understand the frameworks** — NIST IR lifecycle, MITRE ATT\&CK
4. **Tool proficiency** — Pick a SIEM (Sentinel/Splunk), learn one EDR well
5. **Certify** — CySA+ or GCIH to validate baseline competency
6. **Practice continuously** — IR is perishable skill; regular exercises maintain readiness
