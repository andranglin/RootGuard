## Operational Insights & Field Notes

This section serves as an operational journal for RootGuard. Here, I publish technical deep dives, tactical analyses, and strategic commentaries focused on Security Operations (SecOps), Threat Hunting, and Defensive Tradecraft.

Modern defence requires more than just passive monitoring; it requires the ability to anticipate adversary tradecraft before it impacts the enterprise. The goal of this section is to move beyond surface-level advice and dissect the intricacies of hybrid defence—from analysing emerging attack vectors to architecting resilient cloud environments.

#### The Mission

#### What to Expect
