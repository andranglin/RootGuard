## Operational Insights & Field Notes

Technical deep dives, tactical analysis, and defensive tradecraft for security practitioners operating in hybrid enterprise environments.

***

### Purpose

This section serves as an operational knowledge base—publishing practical guidance on Security Operations, Threat Hunting, Detection Engineering, and Incident Response.

Modern defence demands more than passive monitoring. It requires anticipating adversary tradecraft, engineering detections that survive evasion, and building response capabilities that scale. The focus here is hybrid defence: on-premises Active Directory, cloud identity (Entra ID), Microsoft 365, and network perimeter security working as an integrated defensive ecosystem.

***

### The Mission

To provide security practitioners and those entering the field with actionable, field-tested knowledge that translates directly into operational capability.

No theoretical fluff. No vendor marketing. Just practical techniques, detection logic, and investigative workflows you can deploy today.

### Who This Is For

* **SOC Analysts** looking to deepen technical skills and move beyond alert triage
* **Detection Engineers** building and tuning rules for hybrid environments
* **Threat Hunters** developing hypotheses and hunting methodologies
* **DFIR Practitioners** refining investigation and response workflows
* **Career Transitioners** seeking practical knowledge to enter the security field

***

### Approach

Every piece of content follows a consistent philosophy:

* **Operationally focused** — Built for practitioners who need to implement, not just understand
* **Environment-aware** — Contextualised for hybrid Microsoft environments (Defender XDR, Sentinel, Entra ID, on-prem AD)
* **Threat-informed** — Grounded in real adversary behaviour and current attack trends
* **Immediately applicable** — Queries, scripts, and procedures you can use directly

***

### Living Documentation

This knowledge base evolves alongside the threat landscape. Content is continuously updated as new techniques emerge, tooling changes, and operational lessons are learned.

Whether you're defending a growing organisation or a complex enterprise, the goal is operational clarity—the knowledge needed to detect, investigate, and respond effectively.
