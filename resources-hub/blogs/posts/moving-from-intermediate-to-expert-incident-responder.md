# Moving from Intermediate to Expert Incident Responder

Disclaimer: The plan is not for everyone; our journeys are often unique, though sometimes similar. So ignore if you are on a different path.

That being said, the plan is based on acquiring expertise highlighted by the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework. However, it is primarily used for structure and guidance. Similarly, the tools mentioned are more for reference than a must-have.

The **MITRE ATT\&CK framework** is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a structured way to understand and defend against cyber threats. The plan is designed to help progress from an intermediate level to becoming an expert in cybersecurity incident response, with a focus on current threats and advanced use cases.

### **Phase 1: Foundation in MITRE ATT\&CK (6-12 months)**

#### **Objective**: Understand the MITRE ATT\&CK framework and map it to your existing tools and processes.

**Key Actions:**

1. **Learn the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework**:
   * **Tactics & Techniques**:
     * Study the **Enterprise Matrix**, which includes tactics like **Initial Access**, **Execution**, **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Credential Access**, **Discovery**, **Lateral Movement**, **Collection**, **Command and Control**, **Exfiltration**, and **Impact**.
     * Understand how each tactic maps to specific techniques used by adversaries.
   * **Resources**:
     * [MITRE ATT\&CK Navigator](https://attack.mitre.org/)
     * _The MITRE ATT\&CK Defender Training_ (Official MITRE courses)
     * Books like _"Applied Cyber Defense"_ by Rob Lee
2. **Map Tools to MITRE ATT\&CK**:
   * **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**:
     * Learn how Defender detects and mitigates techniques like **Process Injection**, **Credential Dumping**, and **Lateral Movement**.
     * Use **Advanced Hunting** queries to map detections using ATT\&CK techniques.
   * **Splunk & Microsoft Sentinel**:
     * Create dashboards and alerts that align with ATT\&CK techniques.
     * Write KQL/SPL queries to detect behaviours like **Spear Phishing**, **Brute Force**, and **Data Staged for Exfiltration**.
   * **Forensic Tools**:
     * Use **Volatility** to analyse memory dumps for techniques like **Process Hollowing** or **DLL Injection**.
     * Use **Velociraptor** or **KAPE** to collect artifacts related to **Persistence** or **Credential Access**.
3. **Simulate Adversary Behaviour**:
   * Use **Atomic Red Team** or **MITRE Caldera** to simulate ATT\&CK techniques in your lab environment.
   * Practice detecting and responding to simulated attacks using your tools (e.g., Defender, Splunk, Sentinel).
4. **Focus on High-Priority Tactics**:
   * **Initial Access**:
     * Monitor for phishing emails, exploit kits, and external remote services.
   * **Execution**:
     * Detect malicious scripts, PowerShell commands, or scheduled tasks.
   * **Persistence**:
     * Look for registry changes, startup folder modifications, or service creation.
   * **Privilege Escalation**:
     * Identify token manipulation, bypass UAC, or credential dumping.
   * **Defense Evasion**:
     * Detect process injection, file deletion, or disabling security tools.
   * **Credential Access**:
     * Monitor for credential dumping, brute force, or keylogging.

### **Phase 2: Advanced Detection & Response (6-12 months)**

#### **Objective**: Build advanced detection and response capabilities aligned with MITRE ATT\&CK.

**Key Actions:**

1. **Threat Hunting Based on ATT\&CK**:
   * **Hunting Playbooks**:
     * Develop hunting playbooks for high-risk techniques like **Pass-the-Hash**, **Kerberoasting**, or **Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins)**.
     * Use **KQL** (Sentinel) or **SPL** (Splunk) to write custom queries for hunting.
   * **Example Queries**:
     * Detect **Brute Force** attempts: `| where ActionType == "4625" | summarize count() by User`
     * Detect **Scheduled Task Creation** : `EventID=4698`
   * **Tools**:
     * Use **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to hunt for suspicious behaviours.
     * Use **Velociraptor** or **Binalyze AIR** for endpoint forensics during hunts.
2. **Automate Detection & Response**:
   * **Playbooks**:
     * Automate responses to common ATT\&CK techniques using **Azure Logic Apps** (Sentinel) or **Splunk SOAR**.
     * Example: Automatically isolate an endpoint when **Ransomware Execution** is detected.
   * **Scripts**:
     * Write Python or PowerShell scripts to automate artifact collection (e.g., using **KAPE** ) or IOC extraction.
3. **Focus on Lateral Movement & Command and Control**:
   * **Lateral Movement**:
     * Detect techniques like **Remote Services**, **Pass-the-Hash**, or **Exploitation of Remote Services**.
     * Use **network monitoring tools** (e.g., Wireshark, Zeek) to identify unusual traffic patterns.
   * **Command and Control:**
     * Monitor for DNS tunneling, HTTP beaconing, or encrypted C2 channels.
     * Use **EDR tools** to detect suspicious outbound connections.
4. **Incident Response Using ATT\&CK:**
   * **Response Playbooks:**
     * Develop playbooks for each tactic (e.g., **Containment for Credential Access**, **Eradication for Persistence**).
     * Map your incident response steps to ATT\&CK techniques.
   * **Post-Incident Analysis:**
     * Forensic tools like Volatility, Axiom Cyber, or Cyber Triage can be used to analyse compromised systems and extract IOCs.

### **Phase 3: Specialisation & Leadership (6-12 months)**

#### **Objective**: Specialise in advanced use cases and lead incident response efforts using MITRE ATT\&CK.

**Key Actions:**

1. **Specialise in Threat Intelligence:**
   * **Integrate Threat Feeds**:
     * Use threat intelligence platforms (e.g., AlienVault OTX, Recorded Future) to enrich your detection rules with ATT\&CK mappings.
     * Example: Block IPs associated with **Cobalt Strike C2 Servers**.
   * **APT Groups**:
     * Study APT groups like **APT29**, **Lazarus**, or **Conti** and their associated ATT\&CK techniques.
     * Simulate their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in your lab.
2. **Lead Incident Response Teams**:
   * **Tabletop Exercises**:
     * Conduct tabletop exercises based on ATT\&CK scenarios (e.g., ransomware attack, supply chain compromise).
     * Practice coordination between SOC analysts, IR teams, and management.
   * **Cross-Functional Collaboration**:
     * Work with IT, legal, and PR teams to develop comprehensive incident response plans.
3. **Contribute to the Community**:
   * **Share Knowledge**:
     * Write blogs or create videos explaining how to use MITRE ATT\&CK for detection and response.
     * Share your hunting playbooks, scripts, or dashboards with the community.
   * **Open Source Contributions**:
     * Contribute to projects like **Atomic Red Team**, **MITRE Caldera**, or **Velociraptor**.

   * Attend conferences like **MITRE ATT\&CKcon**, **DEF CON**, or **Black Hat**.
2. **Experiment with New Tools**:
   * Explore new tools that integrate with MITRE ATT\&CK, such as **DeTT\&CT**, **AttackIQ**, or **Picus Security**.
   * Use these tools to test your defenses against ATT\&CK techniques.
