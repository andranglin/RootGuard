# Starting a Career in Cybersecurity

### Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity protects systems, networks, and data from cyber threats, including unauthorised access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. It is an essential field in today’s digital landscape, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information. Cybersecurity professionals play a vital role in securing the digital infrastructure of organisations and individuals, working to anticipate, detect, and mitigate evolving threats.

Becoming a cybersecurity professional requires significant effort and commitment. It demands technical expertise, critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical responsibility. Professionals must commit to lifelong learning and adaptability with the field constantly evolving. While challenging, a career in cybersecurity is highly rewarding, offering diverse opportunities, job security, and the chance to make a meaningful impact in protecting valuable assets.

**Note:** Customise the plan to include certification and courses of your choice; those mentioned will provide the relevant knowledge, but they may not suit your personal preferences.

### 6-Month Cybersecurity Career Plan

### Month 1: Build Foundational Knowledge

Start by understanding the basics of IT and cybersecurity. Focus on networking concepts such as TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls, VPNs, and Windows and Linux operating systems. Scripting languages like Python or PowerShell are essential for automating tasks and analysing data. Explore cybersecurity fundamentals, including common threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors.

Action Plan:

* Enrol in beginner courses such as _“Introduction to Cybersecurity”_ (Cisco Networking Academy) or _CompTIA IT Fundamentals (F+)_.
* Use tools like Wireshark to analyse network traffic and practice basic troubleshooting.
* Allocate time daily for structured learning to build a solid foundation.

Goal: Understand networking, operating systems, and cybersecurity fundamentals clearly.

### Month 2: Obtain an Entry-Level Certification

Certifications validate your knowledge and make you a more competitive candidate for entry-level roles. Focus on earning a foundational certification such as CompTIA Security+ or CompTIA Network+. These certifications cover security principles, networking basics, and risk management.

Action Plan:

* Dedicate 1–2 hours daily to studying certification materials.
* Use resources like Professor Messer’s tutorials, practice exams, and official study guides.
* Schedule your exam and focus on passing it within this month.

Goal: Earn your first cybersecurity certification to demonstrate your foundational knowledge.

### Month 3: Develop Practical Skills

Hands-on experience is crucial in cybersecurity. Set up a virtual home lab using tools like VirtualBox or VMware to practice real-world scenarios. Learn how to configure firewalls, analyse logs, and conduct vulnerability scans. Platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box offer interactive, scenario-based challenges to enhance practical skills.

Action Plan:

* Build a virtual lab and practice with tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Splunk.
* Complete hands-on exercises on threat detection, network monitoring, and vulnerability assessment.
* Document your learning and progress in a personal journal or portfolio.

Goal: Gain confidence in using cybersecurity tools and applying practical skills.

### Month 4: Work on Personal Projects

Apply your knowledge by building personal projects that showcase your skills. Projects could include conducting vulnerability scans in your lab environment, automating a security task using Python, or analysing a simulated attack.

Action Plan:

* Create a GitHub repository to store and share your projects.
* Document your findings in professional-style reports or blog posts.
* Use platforms like Medium or LinkedIn to publish your work and demonstrate your expertise.

Goal: Build a portfolio that demonstrates your hands-on skills to potential employers.

### Month 5: Gain Real-World Experience

Begin applying for internships or entry-level roles in IT or cybersecurity. Positions like SOC Analyst, IT Support Technician, or Cybersecurity Analyst are excellent starting points. Volunteer opportunities with nonprofits or small organisations can also provide valuable experience.

Action Plan:

* Apply to internships and entry-level positions that align with your skillset.
* Tailor your resume to highlight certifications, personal projects, and practical experience.
* Join cybersecurity communities and forums to network with professionals and discover opportunities.

Goal: Gain real-world experience in a professional environment while expanding your network.

### Month 6: Apply for Jobs and Continue Learning

With a solid foundation, certification, and practical experience, focus on actively applying for entry-level cybersecurity roles. Prepare for technical interviews by practising explaining key concepts, tools, and scenarios. Simultaneously, start studying for certifications like Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Cisco CyberOps Associate or the more advanced CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+).

Action Plan:

* Apply to at least 10 roles per week, focusing on SOC or analyst positions.
* Practice mock interviews and technical questions, such as explaining firewalls or identifying threats.
* Enrol in a course or training program to deepen your expertise in a specialised area.

### Goal: Secure your first cybersecurity job and continue advancing your knowledge.
