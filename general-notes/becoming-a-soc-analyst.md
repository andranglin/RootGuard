# How To Become A SOC Analyst

### **What is the Role of a Security Analyst?**

A Security Analyst is a crucial team member responsible for safeguarding an organisation’s digital infrastructure. Working primarily within a Security Operations Center (SOC) or similar environments, they specialise in identifying, analysing, and responding to potential security threats.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor threats using security tools like SIEM platforms (e.g., Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel) to detect suspicious activities. This involves analysing logs, network traffic, and alerts from various sources to identify anomalies and trends that may indicate malicious activity.
2. **Analysis**: Investigate alerts to determine their legitimacy and assess potential risks. This includes triaging incidents, correlating data from multiple sources, and leveraging threat intelligence to understand the nature and severity of threats.
3. **Incident Response**: Support senior analysts in responding to and mitigating security incidents. Tasks may involve containing threats, mitigating vulnerabilities, and restoring normal operations while minimising impact on the organisation.
4. **Reporting**: Document findings and generate reports on security events and trends to enhance organisational resilience. Reports may be used to inform management, refine security policies, or comply with regulatory requirements.

### Interview Preparation

#### **1. Understand the Role and Expectations**

* **Learn the Basics**: Familiarise yourself with the day-to-day responsibilities of a Security Analyst, including monitoring, analysis, and response.
* **Common Tools**: Gain experience with industry-standard tools like Splunk, Wireshark, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Explore their dashboards, common use cases, and how they integrate into an organisation's security framework.
* **Focus Areas**: Prioritise foundational skills such as log analysis, threat detection, basic malware analysis, and incident reporting. Understand how these tasks contribute to the overall security strategy.

#### **2. Building a Strong Foundation**

* **Core Concepts**:
  * **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. Understand how these principles guide security policies and solutions.
  * **Types of Attacks**: Learn the mechanisms and indicators of malware, phishing, DDoS, insider threats, and other common attack vectors.
  * **Security Measures**: Study the functionality of firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, and other essential defences.
* **Recommended Resources**:
  * **Free Courses**: Explore Cybrary for SOC-specific modules and TryHackMe for interactive rsecurity labs.
  * **Books**: Read "Cybersecurity Essentials" and "Network Security Fundamentals" to strengthen your theoretical knowledge.
  * **Blogs and Forums**: Follow security blogs and participate in online forums to stay updated on trends and best practices.

#### **3. Learn Basic Networking**

A strong grasp of networking is essential for effective threat analysis and understanding attacker methodologies.

* **Key Concepts**:
  * OSI Model and TCP/IP. Understand how data flows through networks and where vulnerabilities may exist.
  * Common protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP. Know how these protocols function and their role in communication.
  * Basics of IP addressing, subnetting, and DNS resolution. This knowledge helps in recognising anomalies and identifying malicious activities.
* **Hands-on Practice**:
  * Analyse network traffic using Wireshark or TCPdump. Learn how to identify malicious packets or irregular patterns.
  * Use tools like Nmap for network scanning and vulnerability assessment.
  * Set up scenarios to understand how data travels across networks and how attackers may exploit weaknesses.

#### **4. Understand Log formats and Important ID and Types to Monitor**

Logs are the primary source of data for identifying security threats, and understanding them is essential for threat detection and response.

* **Windows Event Logs**:
  * Key Event IDs: 4624 (Successful Logon), 4625 (Failed Logon), 4688 (Process Creation). Learn to filter and interpret these events to identify suspicious activities.
* **Linux Logs**:
  * Understand logs in "/var/log/syslog" and "/var/log/auth.log." Practice identifying authentication attempts, configuration changes, and system errors.
* **SIEM Tools**:
  * Learn basic querying techniques in platforms like Splunk, Sentinel, or ELK Stack. Experiment with creating dashboards, alerts, and reports to simulate real-world monitoring scenarios.

#### **5. Gain Hands-On Experience**

Practical experience is crucial to develop confidence and proficiency.

* **Set Up a Home Lab**:
  * Use VirtualBox or VMware to create isolated environments for testing and learning.
  * Install and configure Windows and Linux virtual machines to simulate enterprise environments.
  * Deploy free tools like Velociraptor, Sysmon, and the ELK Stack for log collection and analysis.
* **Simulate Attacks**:
  * Use tools like Metasploit or Atomic Red Team to understand common attack techniques.
  * Monitor logs and network traffic for anomalies, documenting your findings to build a troubleshooting process.

#### **6. Develop Good Analytical Skills**

Analytical skills are critical for identifying and addressing threats effectively.

* Practice recognising patterns in logs and traffic, correlating data from various sources to uncover insights.
* Map observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, understanding how adversaries operate and the tactics they employ.
* Simulate incident response scenarios to refine your ability to handle real-world challenges.

#### **7. Earn Relevant Certifications**

Certifications validate your skills and demonstrate your knowledge to potential employers.

* **Entry-Level Certifications**:
  * CompTIA Security+
  * (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity
  * EC-Council’s Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
* **SOC-Specific Certifications**:
  * Splunk Core Certified User
  * Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)
  * GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)
  * SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst
  * Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate

#### **8. Prepare for Common Interview Topics**

* **Behavioural Questions**:
  * "How do you handle multiple priorities?" Demonstrate your ability to prioritise and manage time effectively.
  * "Describe a time you solved a problem under pressure." Provide specific examples showcasing your problem-solving skills.
* **Technical Questions**:
  * "What is the difference between a vulnerability, threat, and risk?" Be prepared to explain concepts clearly.
  * "Explain the differences between TCP and UDP." Highlight the use cases and characteristics of each protocol.
  * "How would you investigate a failed logon attempt?" Describe your process from log analysis to remediation.

#### **9. Build a Portfolio**

A well-organised portfolio sets you apart by showcasing your skills and dedication.

* Include projects, labs, certifications, and hands-on experiences.
* Document your approach to solving challenges, including screenshots and detailed explanations.
* Use platforms like GitHub or create a personal website to present your work professionally.

#### **10. Practice with Mock Interviews**

Mock interviews help you refine your communication and problem-solving skills.

* Practice with mentors, peers, or through online platforms.
