# Strategic Roadmap to Becoming a Cybersecurity Specialist

#### **Strategic Roadmap to Becoming a Cybersecurity Specialist in Microsoft Cloud Security, Digital Forensics & Incident Response, and Information Security more broadly**

This roadmap is narrowly focused and assumes you are already at a professional level in cybersecurity. It aims to elevate your expertise primarily in Microsoft Cloud Security, Digital Forensics & Incident Response, and broader Information Security. The plan follows a structured approach, covering **learning, certifications, hands-on experience, projects, and professional development**.

Note: The plan is not for everyone; as you will see shortly, it's designed primarily for someone looking to grow in a predominantly Microsoft environment. Otherwise, adjust to meet your desired outcome.

***

#### **C. Digital Forensics**

* Learn **memory forensics**, **disk forensics**, **network forensics**, and **cloud forensics**.
* Understand **Windows Event Logs**, **Sysmon**, **KQL-based log analysis**, and **Live Response in Defender XDR**.
* Gain expertise in **Velociraptor for endpoint forensics**.
* **Action Items:**
  * Study **Windows Forensics Artifacts** (registry, logs, prefetch, etc.).
  * Learn **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s forensic capabilities**.
  * Set up a **Velociraptor lab** and analyse forensic artifacts.

#### **D. Broader Information Security**

* Keep up with **security governance**, **risk management (GRC)**, and **compliance standards** (ISO 27001, NIST, CIS Controls).
* Study **secure architecture** and **cloud security frameworks** (CIS Benchmarks, Microsoft CAF).
* **Action Items:**
  * Read **Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)** documentation.
  * Review **ISO 27001** and **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.
  * Follow **CISA & Microsoft Security Blogs**.

***

### **Phase 2: Obtain Specialized Certifications (6-9 Months)**

Certifications validate your expertise and enhance your credibility.

#### **A. Microsoft Cloud Security Certifications**

✅ **Microsoft Certified: Identity and Access Administrator Associate (SC-300)**

**Action Items:**

* Use **Microsoft Learn** and **practice labs** for each exam.
* Take **Microsoft Exam Sandboxes** for hands-on experience.

#### **B. Incident Response & Digital Forensics Certifications**

✅ **GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)** – For Incident Response\
✅ **GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA) / GCFE** – For Digital Forensics\
✅ **Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect (SC-100)** – For Security Architecture

**Action Items:**

* Enrol in **SANS Microsoft or other industry-recognised training courses**.
* Use **hands-on labs (CyberDefenders, Blue Team Labs Online, Velociraptor)**.

#### **C. Broader Cybersecurity Certifications**

✅ **CISSP—**&#x46;or information security leadership\
✅ **Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)** – For cloud security expertise

**Action Items:**

* Study using **ISC2 materials & practice tests**.
