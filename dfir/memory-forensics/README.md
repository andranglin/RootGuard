# Memory Forensics

### Introduction

Memory forensics is a critical aspect of cybersecurity investigations that involves analysing the volatile memory (RAM) of a system to uncover evidence of malicious activity, unauthorised access, or other security incidents. Unlike traditional disk forensics, which examines stored data, memory forensics focuses on the active state of a system, capturing information such as running processes, open network connections, loaded drivers, and encryption keys. This makes it particularly valuable for detecting advanced threats like fileless malware, rootkits, and in-memory attacks that leave little to no trace on disk. By extracting and analysing memory dumps, investigators can gain insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, enabling them to respond more effectively and mitigate further risks.

The importance of memory forensics in cyber investigations cannot be overstated. Many modern cyberattacks are designed to operate entirely in memory, bypassing traditional security controls that rely on scanning files stored on disk. For example, ransomware and advanced persistent threats (APTs) often use sophisticated techniques to hide their presence, making memory analysis one of the few ways to detect and analyse such threats. Additionally, memory forensics can reveal critical details about an attacker's activities, such as command-and-control (C2) communications, lateral movement, and data exfiltration attempts. This information is invaluable for understanding the scope of an incident, identifying compromised systems, and building a timeline of events, which is essential for both remediation and legal proceedings.

To conduct memory forensics, investigators use specialised tools like Volatility, Rekall, and Redline, which allow them to parse memory dumps and extract actionable intelligence. These tools can identify malicious processes, uncover hidden artifacts, and reconstruct attacker activities. However, memory forensics requires expertise and careful handling, as volatile data can be easily overwritten or lost if not captured promptly. Despite these challenges, memory forensics remains a cornerstone of modern digital investigations, providing a unique and powerful lens into the inner workings of a compromised system. By integrating memory forensics into their investigative workflows, organisations can enhance their ability to detect, analyse, and respond to sophisticated cyber threats, ultimately strengthening their overall security posture.

Memory forensics relies on a combination of specialised tools and well-defined processes to ensure effective and accurate analysis. Tools like **Volatility**, **Rekall**, and **Magnet RAM Capture** are widely used in the industry to extract and analyse memory dumps. These tools enable investigators to identify running processes, detect injected code, analyse network connections, and uncover hidden artifacts that may indicate malicious activity. Commercial solutions such as **FTK Imager** and **Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer** also provide user-friendly interfaces and advanced features for memory acquisition and analysis. Additionally, integrating memory forensics tools with other cybersecurity platforms, such as SIEMs or endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, can enhance the overall investigative process by correlating memory artifacts with other security events.

Memory forensics typically begins with acquiring a memory dump, which must be done carefully to preserve the integrity of the data. Investigators often use write-blocking tools and trusted acquisition software to capture memory without altering its contents. Once the memory dump is obtained, analysts use forensic tools to parse and analyse the data, looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and suspicious behaviour. Structured methodologies, such as those outlined in the **SANS FOR508** course or the **NIST SP 800-86** guide, help ensure a thorough and systematic approach. Documentation and chain-of-custody procedures are also critical, especially when memory forensics is used in legal or regulatory contexts. By combining advanced tools with rigorous processes, memory forensics professionals can uncover hidden threats and provide actionable insights that are essential for effective incident response and cyber investigations.
