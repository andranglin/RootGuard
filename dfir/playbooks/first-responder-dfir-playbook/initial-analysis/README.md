# Initial Analysis

Initial Analysis in Incident Response Data Analysis

When a cyber incident strikes, the clock starts ticking. The initial analysis is the pivotal first step in any incident response investigation, setting the stage for everything that follows. It’s the moment when responders take stock of the chaos—triaging alerts, identifying affected systems, and gathering the earliest fragments of evidence. In this phase, tools like Magnet AXIOM Cyber, Cyber Triage, Kape, and others become invaluable, allowing analysts to quickly acquire and process data from Windows endpoints, sifting through logs, registry entries, and file systems to spot the telltale signs of compromise. Whether it’s a suspicious logon in the Event Logs or an unexpected executable in Prefetch, this stage is about building a rough picture fast—think of it as the digital equivalent of securing the crime scene before the deeper dive begins.&#x20;

But initial analysis isn’t just about speed but precision under pressure. Analysts must prioritise signal over noise, focusing on key artefacts that hint at the incident’s scope and impact. For instance, a quick scan of USBSTOR registry keys might reveal an unauthorised device connection. At the same time, a spike in PowerShell activity could flag malicious scripting—both critical clues in the opening minutes. Done right, this phase not only confirms the incident but also shapes the investigation’s direction, guiding responders toward the root cause, affected assets, and potential data loss. In this section of the playbook, we’ll explore how to handle initial analysis with a Windows focus, leveraging multiple response tools to turn raw data into actionable insights from the very first pass.

So, as we delve into the nuts and bolts of incident response data analysis, remember that initial analysis is your foundation—a launchpad for unravelling the full story of a cyber event. It’s where intuition meets technology and where tools like AXIOM Cyber empower responders to cut through the clutter with speed and clarity. In the sections ahead, we’ll walk through practical steps, from triaging Windows artefacts to spotting anomalies in real-time, ensuring you’re equipped to handle whatever the next alert throws your way.&#x20;

Let’s get started—because in cyber investigations, the first look often determines the final outcome.
