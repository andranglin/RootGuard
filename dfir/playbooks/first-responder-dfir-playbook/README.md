# First Responder DFIR Playbook

### Objective

As a first responder, your mission is to:

* Detect and assess a cyber incident across an enterprise Windows environment.
* Contain the threat to prevent escalation, lateral movement, or data loss.
* Collect and preserve forensic evidence, including detailed Windows artefacts.
* Document all actions for legal, compliance, and IR team handoff.

A First Responder Cyber Incident Response Playbook is a crucial tool for organisations facing the ever-increasing threat of cyberattacks. This guide provides a clear roadmap for teams identifying, containing, and mitigating cyber incidents. In the critical moments following a breach, time is of the essence, and hesitation or confusion can lead to amplified damage, data loss, or prolonged downtime. By outlining predefined steps—such as isolating affected systems, preserving evidence, and notifying key stakeholders—the playbook ensures that first responders can act swiftly and decisively, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to escalate their impact. This preparation is particularly vital in high-pressure situations where responders might otherwise be overwhelmed by the complexity of a cyber event.&#x20;

Beyond immediate reaction, the playbook is a foundation for consistency and coordination across an organisation. Cyber incidents often require collaboration between technical teams, legal departments, and external partners such as law enforcement or cybersecurity vendors. A well-crafted playbook establishes roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols, preventing missteps that could arise from ad-hoc decision-making. For example, it might detail how to document an incident for regulatory compliance or when to escalate an issue to senior leadership. This standardisation streamlines the response process and builds resilience by enabling teams to train and rehearse scenarios in advance, fostering a proactive rather than reactive cybersecurity culture.&#x20;

Finally, the importance of a First Responder Cyber Incident Response Playbook lies in its role as a living document that evolves with the threat landscape. Cyberattacks are not static; they grow in sophistication, exploiting new vulnerabilities and tactics. A playbook that is regularly updated to reflect emerging risks—such as ransomware trends or cloud-based exploits—ensures that first responders are equipped to handle modern challenges. It also allows organisations to incorporate lessons learned from past incidents, refining their approach over time. In an era where breaches' financial and reputational costs continue to rise, this adaptability makes the playbook an indispensable asset, transforming chaotic firefighting into a disciplined, strategic defence against cyber threats.
