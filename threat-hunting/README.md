# Threat Hunting

## <mark style="color:blue;">**What is Threat Hunting?**</mark>

Threat hunting is the proactive process of searching for cyber threats that have evaded traditional security measures within an organisation’s network. Unlike reactive approaches that respond to alerts, threat hunters seek out hidden or advanced threats by leveraging intelligence, tools, and expertise. This discipline is vital for medium-sized organisations aiming to strengthen their cybersecurity posture without relying solely on automated defences.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Threat hunting helps uncover</mark>

* Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
* Insider threats
* Zero-day exploits
* Anomalies indicating compromise

***

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Skillset Required for Threat Hunting**</mark>

1. **Technical Proficiency**:
   * Strong understanding of operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and their internals.
   * Familiarity with network protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP) and tools for traffic analysis (Wireshark, Zeek).
   * Expertise in endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, or SentinelOne.
   * Ability to analyse log data using SIEM platforms such as Splunk, Elastic Stack, or QRadar.
   * Knowledge of scripting languages like Python, PowerShell, or Bash for automation and data analysis.
2. **Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills**:
   * Proficiency in identifying patterns and anomalies in datasets.
   * Logical reasoning for mapping threats to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework.
   * Curiosity and persistence to follow leads until the root cause is uncovered.
3. **Threat Intelligence Knowledge**:
   * Familiarity with threat intelligence feeds and sources (e.g., VirusTotal, MISP).
   * Understanding of threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
4. **Soft Skills**:
   * Clear communication to report findings and propose mitigations.
   * Team collaboration for sharing insights with SOC teams and stakeholders.
   * Continuous learning to stay ahead of emerging threats.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Tasks and Responsibilities of a Threat Hunter**</mark>

In a medium-sized organisation, threat hunters play a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating risks. Their responsibilities include:

1. **Proactive Threat Discovery**:
   * Analysing logs, traffic, and telemetry data to detect anomalies.
   * Leveraging threat intelligence to uncover potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
2. **Developing Hypotheses**:
   * Using current threat trends and organisational knowledge to form hypotheses about possible attack scenarios.
   * Testing hypotheses through targeted searches and analysis.
3. **Investigation and Analysis**:
   * Performing root cause analysis on suspicious activities.
   * Uncovering hidden malware, lateral movement, or unauthorised access.
4. **Tool and Process Optimisation**:
   * Fine-tuning existing security tools for better detection capabilities.
   * Developing custom scripts or playbooks for repetitive tasks.
5. **Reporting and Recommendations**:
   * Documenting findings in detailed reports.
   * Advising on remediation steps and security improvements.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Training and Certifications Required**</mark>

Training and certifications validate a threat hunter’s expertise and ensure readiness for advanced challenges. Key certifications include:

1. **GIAC Certified Threat Hunter (GCTH)**:
   * Focuses on advanced threat-hunting techniques and tools.
2. **Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (CTIA)**:
   * Covers threat intelligence gathering and analysis.
3. **MITRE ATT\&CK Defender (MAD)**:
   * Emphasises mapping and utilising the ATT\&CK framework.
4. **CompTIA CySA+**:
   * A foundational certification for cybersecurity analysis and threat detection.
5. **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**:
   * Broadens knowledge of security operations and governance.
6. **SANS Threat Hunting and Advanced Incident Response (FOR508)**:
   * Advanced training for hands-on threat hunting and forensic investigation.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Path to Becoming an Effective Threat Hunter**</mark>

1. **Educational Background**:
   * Obtain a degree in computer science, cybersecurity, or information technology.
   * Pursue specialised courses in cybersecurity or threat intelligence.
2. **Building Foundational Skills**:
   * Start as a SOC analyst to understand incident monitoring and response.
   * Learn log analysis, network forensics, and malware analysis through hands-on practice.
3. **Hands-On Practice**:
   * Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and labs like TryHackMe or Hack The Box.
   * Experiment with open-source tools like ELK Stack, Suricata, or Security Onion.
4. **Certifications and Continuous Learning**:
   * Earn certifications that align with your career goals.
   * Stay updated with the latest threat reports, tools, and trends.
5. **Engage with the Community**:
   * Join cybersecurity forums, attend conferences, and network with professionals.
   * Contribute to threat intelligence sharing platforms or blogs.

By embracing a continuous learning mindset, aspiring threat hunters can develop the skills to safeguard their organisation against sophisticated cyber threats. Proactive defence is a skill and a commitment to securing the digital landscape.
